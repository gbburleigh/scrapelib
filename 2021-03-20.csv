The last updated date would be useful on JSS-update day, if it actually updated at the same time as JSS did. But, it updates hours before the stats change, so it's really meaningless.Recent account holds and TR eligible weeks?

A trend graph would make it more useful, but even so, it's not all that important.Marketing effectiveness: this can go. Without more context, it's meaningless. I was viewed slightly less often than people in Writing? Ok, that's fine, but that's a pretty broad category, so I don't know why I should care. But the green bar for interviewed is close to full? How does that make sense with the viewed graph being so low? Without details of how it's calculated, this looks wrong and untrustworthy. And I was hired a bit more often than average? Ok good, but again, it's too broad a category for me to really care.The profile view graph: this can go. There's no information here about what it's counting. I vaguely remember it's related to search, but that's it. And it often goes to 0 for weeks at a time, when I know my profile is getting viewed cause I'm getting invites.
