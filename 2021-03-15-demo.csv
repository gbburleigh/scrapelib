We need safety measures, too.Like, for example, will upwork ever put a system in place that weeds out flakey clients - you know, the ones that cancel the job after 50+ freelancers spent time writing personal proposals and sending their previous work?Or what about a rule that says clients can't demand artists/creators to send very specific ""auditions"" in order to be considered for the job? Like with voice overs and musical composition jobs, there are many clients that want you to send them recordings of their script or the actual music project before even being considered for the job. And what usually happens with those clients? They close the job without choosing a single cadidate and they vanish. Because they got all the goods they needed without paying a dime.It's hard enough finding work on this site with so many freelancers on here.I feel like the clients needs are always top priority for upwork and that causes this website to neglect the needs of its freelancers.

Mexican Withholding Tax on Upwork Earnings,3/12/21 9:07,,249bec584725a04f,ActiveMember,"Hi Raymundo,       Yes, I'm in the 'taxes will skyrocket to infinite' basket. I understand what you describe, the only thing that's different from what I was told is the VAT/IVA, it's still 16% no matter if you're in the under or over 300K regime, the only difference is 8% is withheld by the client and you're on the hook for the remaining 8% (which you may be able to 'compensante' with your expenses, but you're still liable for 16% either way). This is the same scheme when performing services to personas morales (S.A. de C.V or other) in Mexico, where they withhold taxes that they use for cashflow and sometimes don't even end up paying, albeit they're taxes 'in your favor',you won't know if they payed or not until you claim them at the declaracion anual.       On the ISR front it's a mixed bag I agree, the only way to escape this is to be in the under 300K regime so that the 1% ISR withheld by the client is considered final. If you're over that, it's actually even a rolling window for withholding that needs to be made -- up to 5-6% iirc -- although Upwork hasn't even mentioned this, they assume everyone will be under the 300K regime. If you're over 300K, that's when ISR skyrockets from a final definitive 1% (under 300K) to double digits, so you're better off earning less than 300K than say 400k or 500k, because the different will be gobbled up in the final ISR calculation.        Best case scenario all us will pay 17% more in taxes (16% IVA, 1% ISR), all compensatable of course, but every new compensation/deduction, adds risk to an audit. Worst scenario 50% more! (16% IVA, 34% ISR cap). All of this after the 20%, 15%, 5% fees from Upwork.      So yeah, everyone from Mexico on Upwork will be working hard so the bulk of their income goes to the mexican government and Upwork, congrats to all!

Upwork is an intermediary platform that connects potential customers with people who provide a service. Also they should not withhold VAT because at the time of one as a Mexican resident providing a service abroad is taxed at 0% rate according to current tax laws (which dictate this reduction of VAT to avoid losing competitiveness in an international market).I share the same experience as Raymundo, I have been working in Upwork for almost a year and all my tax obligations as a taxpayer have been presented accurately before the competent authority. And within my fiscal situation there is something called RIF regime, which gives me reductions on the ISR and VAT, which would be diminished because you would be withholding VAT without any reason.Your legal team needs to get advice and investigate more about this new tax reform, because you are attributing to yourselves obligations that do not correspond to you.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Mexican-Withholding-Tax-on-Upwork-Earnings/td-p/872655

Testing video chat profile verification,6/12/20 8:46,,238e90db36af214d,ActiveMember,"I have been a Freelancer for a few months now and I verified my identity with the phone call weeks ago. I received an email a few days ago saying that I need to verify my identity and that my account will be on hold until I do that. I tried to do it again but it says that I already completed it. Meanwhile, I am unable to submit any proposals. In addition, I have tried numerous times to speak with someone regarding my bank account not matching my name. I am in the process of changing my name due to a divorce so my account doesn't match my ID name. I am sure I am not the only one who has had to go through this process and I have not been able to speak with a human about clearing this up.So, I am extremely frustrated at this point because not only am I unable to submit proposals due to an error with verifying my identity but I also can't get paid for projects I already completed.

Personally I don't find it useful at all, as there are only ever 3 or 4 jobs that appear in my UK only feed and they don't change very often. But whatever – this may change given time, and although it seems like a pretty useless feature for freelancers (in my case at least), it doesn't bother me very much to give that option to clients.However, it's REALLY annoying for freelancers to have the default Find Work feed be set to UK only. Every time I go to search for work I have to click to go to the second tab.The vast majority of my clients come from outside the UK and so I don't foresee a time when I'm likely to only want to see jobs from UK clients.I'd suggest one of the following, in order of preference:1) Give me an integrated feed as the default containing all jobs relevant to me, with an option to filter to UK only if you must. But please don't make the filtered list the default.2) Allow some customisation of the Home feed so that individual freelancers can choose which feed they'd like to see as their default.3) Failing either of the above, I'd actuallyprefer to unverify mylocation so that I remove the possibility of seeing UK only jobs. Is this possible? I'm aware this would possibly restrict the jobs I see, but for the moment, that doesn't seem to be a problem for me (i.e., there's stillmore than enough work without a location requirement). Indeed, many of my clients are from the US which seems to suggest that many clients are also happy to hire freelancers from across the world.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Location-Selection-Expanding-to-UK-Clients/td-p/520548

In case of an ongoing Upwork contract I may get one bad feedback for disappearing into nowhere, but I can live with that. The projects however will get auto-accepted day after day. I'll keep losing my score just because I won't have an option to check my profile and reject them. It really seems too unfair, don't you think so?So yeah, my question is: are you planning to adjust this setting in a future?

If you included revisions in your project, those can be requested after the deadline. Note: Delivery days are calendar days, not business days.

My first project client has been great, but I didn't realise that if he hadn't messaged me then I could have been taking on any brand new, untested client.This goes back to the massive transparency issue in general - I have brought up (aka complained heavily) multiple times in the past few months in the UC about how I consistently feel backed into a corner by the way in which Upwork choose to allow clients and freelancers to interact.• When a potential client messages you directly (not in PC, but in general) about a project, but has not posted a physical project listing, you can only see their star rating but cannot see their feedback / feedback they have left for others• Clients can add milestones onto a pre-existing contract at their whim, and decide the parameters and price, without any freelancer approval necessary - meaning they could just continue adding things for whatever price they desire and then claim that the freelancer didn't deliver, even if they just picked a random or arbitrary price.• You only have 24 hours to reject a PC project, and if you don't, it automatically is accepted. If anything it should be the opposite; if someone hasn't replied to a legitimate job offer in 24 hours, they probably are busy / inactive / not ready to take on anything new at the time whether it's for personal reasons or scheduling reasons. That means you can't even take a full weekend off from checking your Upwork profile in case a project that is unsuitable for your skillset comes in.If I did not get so much work through this site, I genuinely would leave over this. I feel like a broken record but the fact that freelancers don't have absolute control over their end of a contract / project acceptance, the same way that clients have absolute control on their end, is absolutely disgusting and rubs me as totally dishonest. There is NO reason for this issue unless UW is genuinely trying to discourage freelancers from rejecting jobs, even if it sets up the final result to be unsatisfactory and lead to a dispute (or a black mark on someone's feedback even just for being hired on a project and then canceling it, which still allows the client to leave private input). Their motivation seems to be that everyone should take on every job because then they have a chance of making more money in fees and that is that.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Goodbye-beta-hello-Project-Catalog-now-available-globally/td-p/858605

I've run into one major stumbling block. When I set up the 3 tiers for my project, the options include don't allow me to adequately describe the differences between the tiers. It would be much better, in my opinion, if there was a least one customizable description field, or one open text variable.I'll use an example to be clearer. I develop Excel based macros. I do have several common types of projects where I could see this being a useful way to connect with clients.Let's say I want to create a catalogue project for automated updating of Powerpoint presentations from Excel data. The predefinied options on the tiers let me set either # of Macros, or # of Buttons/Forms.Cients would have no idea how many ""macros"" their project would use. If I had a custom text field option, I would set it as :# Of Different Source Files:# Of Powerpoint elements UpdatedAlternatively, if there was a blank text description for each tier, I could describe differences in general. I could set one to ""PC"" and one to ""Mac"" and one for ""PC/Mac"" as on some projects the code can be more complex on Macs. Its not always Starter/Standard/Advanced , sometimes its A/B/C...I'm sure upwork is trying to standardize the approach as much as possible to streamline the approval process. I've seen moderator responses stating that freelancers can set whatever terms and details so we can control the process, but without being able to customize the tiers at all, its very difficult.(And, of course, if I'm mistaken, and there is a way to customize the tiers, please let me know)Thanks",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Goodbye-beta-hello-Project-Catalog-now-available-globally/td-p/858605

Specialized Profiles Soon Available in All Categories,2/16/21 8:35,,15503a60942dc139,ActiveMember,"I created a specialized profile a few weeks ago which is done but I not polished yet because I had to work on existing clients and find more jobs. However, over the last few weeks, I have not been getting any responses from jobs I have applied for. I was scratching my head trying to figure out why. I usually get about a 20-25% response for all the jobs I bid on. Now I get 0%.Today, I think I know why. It was that specialized profile I created. When I bid on jobs, it defaults to the specialized profile which is not what I wanted to happen. So now I know the cause. However, I don't want it to be default to that specialized profile. I still want it to default to my 'general profile'. It makes sense that it should be the default and then use specialized profile for certain jobs you want to bid on.Right now, I just want to get rid of it. However, I can't delete the profile nor can I unpublish it. It's too bad you cannot change the profile of an already job bid. Oh yeah, I know, they say you can choose the profile just prior to submitting your bid. But that's too late for me and I think I may have flushed over 40 connects down the drain.So I guess I am not looking for a fix but maybe I just wanted to share my thoughts and ideas.1. Allow more flexibility to determine which profile is the default. I actually like to keep my 'general profile' as the default but it seems I cannot do that.2. Allow the ability to delete any and all specialized profiles thus the 'general profile' will be the only profile.3. Do not restrict the displaying of income/jobs done based on a specialize profile. Unless you are doing a $100k business, this can hurt your potential of getting jobs. (see attached screenshot).4. When a freelancer submits a job and have mistakenly used the wrong profile, allow the freelancer the ability to change it until the client first access the proposal.Finally, although the specialized profile is a good idea, I wish Upwork would take careful consideration of how it might effect some of us. When introducing a new feature that might possibly effect the freelances ability to make money (positive or negative), be sure allow the freelancer the ability to revert back to the legacy version for at least 6 months to a year thus it will allow freelancers enough time to try it out and hopefully master it. Otherwise, if they are not ready for it, they can revert back. And when Upwork finds that the new feature is a postive change, then they can start alerting those that have not made the transition allowing them maybe like 2-3 months to make the switch.I love Upwork. My only beef is when they make changes that they should look at every angle of how it might a effect freelancers. I don't mind change but I like time to study it and play with it without effecting my earnings. I can't always free up time to learn something new if I am working.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Specialized-Profiles-Soon-Available-in-All-Categories/td-p/578260

Unlike the general profile, the specialized profile will allow you to create a separate title and overview, as well as set a different rate. It will also let you go into more detail about the type of skills you do work in. For example, for mobile development: programming languages, types of devices you develop on, which categories of apps you’ve worked on, etc. In the future, we plan to launch a way for you to create specialized profiles based off of your general profile more easily. Specialized profiles you create will be visible when you or a client clicks into your existing general profile, and clients can post jobs using a template that matches these new profiles. Specialized profiles will also be shown when you show up in relevant search results. Whether your general or specialized profile is shown will vary depending on the scenario and choices you make:When a client uses the search function to search for freelancers we will show them your most relevant profile. For example, if they specifically search for mobile app development and you have a specialized mobile app development profile, that profile will be shown in search results. When you submit a proposal for a job, your most relevant specialized profile will be shown to the client when they are reviewing proposals. If you don’t have a specialized profile, the client will see your general profile. While one profile will be shown by default, the client will always be able to view all versions of your profile. Note: The ability for freelancers to submit a specialized profile with a proposal will be added later. We’ll keep you’ll posted!Here are some other scenarios:You want to send a link to your profile to a client. You can choose to send direct links to your general profile or to your specialized profiles. Someone clicks on your profile from a post you made in our Community. Your general profile will be shown by default, but they’ll be able to view your other profiles.A client accesses your profile from an old contract or past discussion in Messages.

In short I have the skills required to take a web or software development project from conception to completion excluding the actual technical and coding work.I would also like to create a second profile that focuses on online research, content strategy, business writing, content writing, copywriting, editing and proofreading, ghostwriting and technical writing, translation and instructional design.As you will notice, especially with the first profile, my skills come from a wide variety of specialties and even categories of specialties. There simply is no way using the current profile options that I can create a custom basket of skills like that to promote myself.I can understand why one would want to limit oneself to one category if one was dealing with a newbie to work or the Upwork platform. But I have 30 years of experience and it comes from a variety of fields and I cannot be pigeonholed.

Faster payouts for hourly contracts,6/20/20 6:10,,e772ba4ca3879af2,ActiveMember,"Hello, thank you for the reply.I apologize for not clarifying.Prior to the 'faster payout', my hourly contracts I would get by Friday of the same week that I requested the payout, which occured on Wednesday/Thursday.Now the payout is not showing in my bank account until Monday/Tuesday of the next week.So it is not faster in my opinion when looking at payment history & this new format.To better reference dates for this scenario.Pre- faster payout new setup, I would see payment available from Upwork for hourly contracts on Wednesday June 17, request the payment to bank and receive payment into my bank by Friday June 19.Now with faster payout, the payment does not show as available until Thursday June 18, and payment not received into my bank until Monday June 22.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Faster-payouts-for-hourly-contracts/td-p/739876

I thought that all contracts had a 5-day waiting period for payments (must have read and forgotten since I don't work on hourly contracts). Anyway, first of all, I applaud the effort since it shows that Upwork is really thoughtful of freelancers and that's a good thing, thank you. Now, since there are those of us who work exclusively on fixed price contracts and are yet to get any such conveniences, why not reduce the times a little bit, even from 5 to maybe 2 days? That would really help. And since it was possible for the majority of contracts, I guess the fewer fixed price contracts shouldn't be much of a problem.

I'd understand if these contracts were being looking at separately but as mentioned the entire amount was available from the time of the first email.

Faster payouts for hourly contracts,5/8/20 13:25,,1a63bf5a63c71b24,CommunityGuru,"Just got a note from the proverbial CFO of Upwork. Our earnings -- normally to be released on Tuesday/Wednesday of next week -- were released today. Sure enough, there it was in the Upwork bank account.I see a continual parade of complaining about how much connects cost or how many have to be used... and so on,. I see a continual parade of complaining about not getting enough invites. Or how cumbersome the system is to use... and on. And on. And on. Surely a function of the forum. Air one's disappointments. But gosh, that train is long and never-ending. That level of complaining would last about one week in corporate America. Then the complainer would be invited to leave and try it somewhere else.A company just released 10s of millions of dollars globally, without apparently a hiccup. Some folks at Upwork have their working hats on this week.I do so wonder. Behind their proverbial doors. Do the whine and complain as much about us, as we, them. No, is the answer.Good job Upwork. I'll order some Dominos tonight and tip the delivery person 40% as my pass-on-the-niceness act today.

If we net off the charges paid on upwork then our turn over would be $80 which will be a mismatch in records. So if we show $100 as our turnover and shows $20 paid to upwork as Fees , it should be considered as import of services and will be liable to pay 18% GST on the same.This is my understanding.

However, today I was thinking about one very important topic in contrast of assigning badges and its core benefits. I mean, there should be improvement in TOP RATED PLUS criteria. For example: under the category of “Web, Mobile & Software Dev”, the term large contract will consider if or if its threshold criteria will exact on $15000 (for individual) and $30000 (for agency). Now a days, the scope of under this category (web, mobile and software) is on top (as compare to all other categories), so the competition is also too high under this category where client want to make the product under $5k (I have got lot of requests to make PubG type game clone only for $5k). So its almost impossible to achieve $15000 job as an individual (I am not saying for an agency because they has the team caliber to show strength for $30k project) for mobile app/game projects within 12 months. I have been working on upwork since 2011 but could not get any single job with $15k budget.Conclusion: I have been working on Upwork since 2011 when it was oDesk (I did not migrate from E-Lance), and purely working for game development from my first day. So you can say I am master in this category with 9+ years of experience only from upwork and overall I have 12+ years of work experience in same area, even I could not get any of single job/project with the budget of $15k. Means I am not a Top 1% candidate as per upwork’s current system??? I am sure there will be few more high experienced freelancers like me, but they are struggling for getting high budget job because they had outed from current system. So, to save highly experienced freelancers career, today I am just trying to explore reality. I hope Upwork will understand my point and take the strong step immediately.SUGGESTIONS: For the “Top Rated Plus” category, the long contract criteria should be reduced from $15k to $10k for individual freelancer, and from $30k to $25k for agencies. But if or if they has below specific terms:A) For Individual freelancer———————————————√ Upwork experience 7+ years (E-lance experience should not be consider)√ Upwork overall earning more than to $75k (E-lance earning should not be consider)B) For Agency—————————√ Upwork experience 10 or more years (E-lance experience should not be consider)√ Upwork overall earning more than to $500k (E-lance earning should not be consider)",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-talent-badges-are-now-available/td-p/778142

I'm a multidsicplinary french SEO copywriter and everything works fine for me. From now, I meet 2 criterias of the Top Rated Plus Badge : 1) I'm going to have soon the 10K earning before 12 months 2) I'm a top rated plus.My question is about the third criterion : the large project. I was actually wondering If I meet this criterion since I worked in a large project from where I earned more then 5K - this is the limit established for the writing field - but this project has more than 2 years actually. This contract is still active tough ! The fact that this contract is still active, altough it started more then two years ago, will allow me to fulfill this criteria ?On the other hand, I actually worked with the same client over the last 6 months, but he splitted the contract in two : the first one I earned 3900 usd and he closed it and the second which is still active, I actually earned 2000 usd and i'm still going to earn from it. If we count then, I'm having more then 5K with the same client but in two differents contracts - because we passer from a niche to another one. Is this enough to qualify me for the Top Rated Plus Badge ?Thanks in advance for your answers and keep being awesome!PS : I'm actually a french copywriter, sorry for all the english mistakes I could have made.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-talent-badges-are-now-available/td-p/778142

We base these amounts on the opportunities currently available on Upwork. For example, in certain categories, a large contract might be one with earnings of $5,000 but in others it might be a $20,000 or $30,000 contract.Now - I am fine with those amounts but my suggestion is to change the requirement from ""Large Contracts"" to ""Large Accounts"" which means that the system will calculate earnings of $5,000, $20,000 or $30,000 not to any particular contract but for a total sum of the contract you have with a client.The reason and logic for that change in the definition are that in many cases, we have clients we work with on large projects which broken down to a few contracts.Looking only at individual contracts as a criteria for ""large"" is not the right way to evaluate the $ value - the right way to do it is to calculate the total sum of all the contracts you have with each particular client and if that amount passed 5k, 20k or 30k - that will be the sum the system should evaluate for the criteria as ""large"" and bump you up for Top Rated Plus.Anyone with me on that and see the logic in it?",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-talent-badges-are-now-available/td-p/778142

Now it's also a question of success. Before there was not a necessity to follow the rule 1 project = 1 contract, so sometimes clients preferred not to pause the contract, but close it, and then start the new one (for the same project in fact). Even then some clients asked me about the possibility to combine a few contracts in one for easier management. Now it's also could be useful for freelancers because we need to have 'one or more large* contracts in the past 12 months without negative outcomes' to get the badge 'top rated plus'.I've read the topic about new badges and seems like it's a pretty common issue: a lot of us have large and longterm contracts which will never count as large because they are split into several separate contracts. I understand that maybe we have to prove somehow that these contracts are really connected with the same project, but I'm sure everyone is ready to work on it.I really hope that if this function is needed not only by me but also by a significant part of the community, we can see it implemented in the near future.

Accepting this advice, asking the client to close the job is sufficient. Like many others here, I will do everything possible to avoid mentioning feedback, or any other internal Upwork process, to clients. Also, that ""will minimize"" is rather strong without knowing, as no one can know, exactly what kind of feedback the client will leave.Out of curiosity, if a client can't close a contract without leaving feedback, how do jobs end up closed in the feeds/profiles with ""No feedback given?"" Perhaps they don't have to leave public feedback? Private feedback does absolutely no good when it's not visible to the clients looking at our profiles. They will see our JSS percentage, but most of them really have no idea how that intertwines with public vs. private feedback and all the other ""things"" woven into that score. I think it's a bit confusing to tell people they don't have to remind client's to leave feedback when that is a mantra around here so we don't end up with a string of ""No Feedback Given"" because that damages the JSS, as well. What am I missing? Your sentiment seems to vary greatly from the masses.Clients have to give star ratings, as well as private feedback (Would you recommend...?) when they close jobs. They do not have to give a narrative public feedback.When they close a job with no public written feedback, only the stars appear, no text.When the freelancer closes the job and the client does not respond to Upwork's prompt(s) to leave feedback, ""No feedback given"" appears.""No feedback given"" or some similar wording may also appear temporarily if there is a delay in feedback showing upon completion of the double-blind process.Whenever it is to my advantage to close a job, I'll ask the client to do so first, and do it myself if there is no response within a week. No need whatsoever to mention feedback; I leave mine, and Upwork prompts them to leave theirs.""Sentiment""?

Post Covid-19 and the firm gone I tried very hard literally sending out a large number of proposals. And got lucky!Got 2-3 clients with good feedback, earned rising talent soon and that helped me win few more good projects 2 projects with 1K+ value and a few small projects. Within 1 month I was eligible for Top Rated and was waiting for 13 weeks to end...within two months I am 5K plus in 12 months earning.Now, most client experiences have been great, but one client with a project value of $ 200 gave me 4.8-star rating and no feedback and my Client who would recommend me dropped to 88%, I used to check my stats every two days and after that $200 value contract closed the score dropped and the following Monday my JSS dropped to 95%.So that got me a little worried because in 3 weeks I might have become Top Rated, I was just waiting for 13week period to complete, as I met all other criteria for Top Rated. How and why did a $200 job caused 5% decrease in the score? Some might argue I can't be sure it is because of that project but I know it for a fact it was her rating because I did not close any contract after 28th Nov except for her contract which was closed on 15th Dec.Now my question is how can I ensure I sail through these 3 weeks period without any problem and become a top-rated freelancer? Should I just avoid closing open contracts? and let them close it after the 3rd week of Jan?

I have also had a look at the link shared.This is sad though, for the freelancers as there are clients who are not cooperative and WILL give bad private feedback that directly affects JSS since that is how it works as per your explanation/link.And then this ""...a one-week $1,000 job will be weighted more than a one-week $20 job..."" which means I really have to take care while bidding on a project with a higher budget and agree to more work (for free) if a client forces and even threatens to leave bad feedback. And the post also mentions ""Positive feedback on contracts with no earnings will not be factored into JSS once we move to the new calculation."", why? A client leaving a positive feedback without earnings means the client/freenalcer agreed mutually on ending a contract with no hard feelings.I guess I agree with most of the posts related to JSS on this community forum requesting/suggesting Upwork to work on their JSS calculation to attract more freelancers. I have read posts by freelancers who were shocked to see the drop in JSS all of sudden, even with positive project completion rate.As for my current dilemma, I guess I can only pray that the client does not push me to do extra work and when the contract ends, he gives me a positive ""private"" feedback. Because that is what matters now, not the feedback we see publicily on a profile. I guess from now on, I have to request (beg) the client to leave a positive ""private"" feedback.Thanks",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Job-size-will-now-be-factored-into-your-JSS/td-p/697918

Accepting this advice, asking the client to close the job is sufficient. Like many others here, I will do everything possible to avoid mentioning feedback, or any other internal Upwork process, to clients. Also, that ""will minimize"" is rather strong without knowing, as no one can know, exactly what kind of feedback the client will leave.Out of curiosity, if a client can't close a contract without leaving feedback, how do jobs end up closed in the feeds/profiles with ""No feedback given?"" Perhaps they don't have to leave public feedback? Private feedback does absolutely no good when it's not visible to the clients looking at our profiles. They will see our JSS percentage, but most of them really have no idea how that intertwines with public vs. private feedback and all the other ""things"" woven into that score. I think it's a bit confusing to tell people they don't have to remind client's to leave feedback when that is a mantra around here so we don't end up with a string of ""No Feedback Given"" because that damages the JSS, as well.

With 100% JSS, I was having troubles getting a job out of 10 proposals.Perhaps clients think of 100%'ers as ""nah, that cant be real""? I dont know. Just sharig my experience. While at first I was not happy with the 8% drop for a reason I'll never know of, today I am very happy it dropped.With this new job size change, it went up to 95%. Job acceptance rate is still very high, even on 50+ proposals. I think I'm just getting good at applying to those jobs only which I know my profile and past experience is perfect for.Just my 2 cents. I know my profile and other aspects needs work, but it seems to be working for now. Remember, breathe.

As of March 1st, the Upwork JSS math has been altered. Here's what the email said, in summary: Upwork's JSS math will now value ratings provided on low dollar contracts, vs. longer-term, higher dollar projects in different ways. The implication for this Upworker was simple:I had hired my mentee in a string of phased projects, closely sequenced so as to divide up his $250 project into three smaller-dollar projects. This, in turn, means I could correctly, fairly, and within the guidelines of all Upwork policies - place three 5-0s into his profile, vs one. Phased project strategy, there were definitive phases, all is fair and correct in doing this. Most surely hiring clients have the option to phase projects. I exercised that option.So the news in this email from Upwork is clear. I speak for my interpretation of this, and in no other way: the JSS math will apparently now process on a smaller-dollar projects than it does, larger dollar projects. I am curious to know if anyone else has gotten this email.So much for the tactic of phasing my mentee's projects correctly and as can be done according to all guidelines of Upwork. Hiring clients can in fact chose their phases. Apparently doing so in ways that create a string of smaller, closely-sequenced projects will now catch the attention of the JSS Big Math analytics routines.This would have impact on various circumstances one might wish to consider.John.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Job-size-will-now-be-factored-into-your-JSS/td-p/697918

You can still get to 100% JSS with smaller budget jobs; we are just giving more weight to jobs with higher earnings.

Job size will now be factored into your JSS,3/4/20 14:57,,5a0f8c31b7049fe0,AceContributor,"I think Upwork should simply get rid of the complex and mysteriously-calculated JSS rating, feedback and many of the other complexities that it has accumulated over the years. I miss the oDesk days, the platform was so much simpler and cleaner, it served its purpose without getting into the way.JSS is supposed to indicate the freelancer's success, but what is success? For a freelancer, this is simply being able to make a decent living and grow professionally by offering his honest and professional services as an independent professional. That's all. Freelancer's success has nothing to do with the client's opinion, it has nothing to do with how a project ended, it has nothing to do with the size of the project and nothing to do with how long a project has been idle.In my opinion, Upwork should replace all of this with 3 things:- A system to weed out dis-honest freelancers.As long as a freelancer is honest and genuine his abilities to get work should not be hindered.- A system of testimonials by past or active clients (instead of feedback at the end of the project). One problem with the current system is that some contracts really have no end, and that means a lot of work done with no feedback being provided for it. I have a few clients that I have been working with for multiple years on the same contract, would love to be able to get a testimonial from them.- Statistics on the number of projects or working hours completed both globally and short term (which is practically the same as it is now) which as I said above is the real metric of success.Many of the world's most successful people were at some point ridiculed and rejected by others, but the opinion of those others this didn't stop them from becoming successful ...and yet here we are on a platform in which someone's success is based on the opinion of others instead of one's own achievements.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Job-size-will-now-be-factored-into-your-JSS/td-p/697918

Before cancelling the contract, he sent me lots of messages (which were directed to me, but also to many other freelancers he had hired at the same time). He kept saying that Upwork wasn't allowing him to use his account due to his own misuses, so he would have to cancel the contracts and set them again through a different account.Ultimately, he cancelled my contract (and I suppose everyone else's, and his account seemed to be deleted) and sent me a request to release the money on escrow, which I accepted. A few days later, they invited me to send a proposal through a different account, but never replied to my messages. Then, on Sunday, my JSS dropped to 88% and I lost my Top Rated badge. Does that make sense? I mean, I thought this wasn't supposed to impact on my JSS. Is there anything I can do now?

On the other hand, I think it does make JSS a little better as a measure of actual success, which is what it's meant to be. The old no-earnings rule often significantly penalised a freelancer for having a client who simply changed their mind.

However, after this change contracts with no feedback will no longer impact JSS. I'd like to note, however, that there are other factors that are and will continue to be included in the calculation such as long-term relationships for example. If you didn't see any changes to your score, it's possible that the number of no feedback contracts you have wasn't significant enough to affect your score before. Additionally, the score will continue to be calculated for 6-, 12- and 24-month windows and thebestscore out of these moving time windows will be displayed on your profile and updated about every two weeks.

Explain that you're striving to make a career here on Upwork and every bit of good feedback that you can get helps you move up. There's no harm in asking and, as far as I know, it's permissible - at least it was when I checked a few years ago. But just to be safe, maybe ask a staff member if it's OK to petition the client.

An excellent change in policy, one that will more fairly represent those of us who work very hard to make sure our clients are happy, but do not ask for reviews. As you've recognized, the reason clients don't leave a review is not necessarily because they aren't happy. Sometimes (as so many of us do) they simply have what I think of as ""review fatigue"" - they are tired of being asked. And, for many people, having to write a review (beyond checking boxes) is an onerous task ... not everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves.   I know in various surveys I've received I've addressed this issue and I have to assume there were many others who did also, which is why the policy has changed. I hope you feel confident that this change will be good for eveyrone here at Upwork. For me, it's already meant two things (in just one day): an increase in invites and my feeling more comfortable about my profile which is now back up to 100% JSS.

No feedback contracts no longer impact Job Success Score (JSS),11/11/20 8:26,,c41452793bfb09ae,ActiveMember,"The current system ""requires"" a client to rate the job before ending a contract if he is the one to close the contract. This ""rating"" serves as the feedback that JSS takes into account.1) Is Upwork removing the requirement that a rating be entered when a contract is ended so that this new change can work? There is currently no way for a client to end a contract without a rating (unless the client or freelancer contacts support, and only under rare, unpublished circumstances, will support close a contract on behalf of a client or freelancer ""without a rating"".This new change is headed in a good direction, but at first glance needs to do MUCH more to protect freelancers at the most basic level.For example, a client hires a freelancer, but before sending the requirements of the job, after the contract is started, disappears for days or weeks, without explanation. Another example -- a client hires a freelancer, then asks the freelancer offline to violate the terms of services (receiving pay outside of the platform, or requesting work that is drastically different from what was agreed upon in the contract). In both of these examples, a freelancer may be forced to close a contract without earnings to protect the integrity of his/her profile and/or JSS score (contracts that span more than several weeks without earnings negatively impact JSS). Clients often have understandable reasons for abandoning a job before its officially started due to internal work priorities, for example, or they didn't quite understand the platform, etc. In either instance, this is due to NO FAULT of the freelancer, yet the freelancer is currently being penalized. Either way, the client would be prompted by Upwork to leave a rating on the job that was closed -- which could work disfavorably for a freelancer who is simply being diligent because the client didn't properly understand the impacts of abandoning a job for weeks on the freelancer and their profile.2) Upwork should completely disable the ability to leave a rating on a contract that is ended without earnings (regardless of the reason) in addition to implementing this new feature to remove the impact of a contract that ends with no rating (closed by support) from JSS calculation.Allow me to help you make this platform a welcome place for both clients and hard-working freelancers.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/No-feedback-contracts-no-longer-impact-Job-Success-Score-JSS/td-p/824751

That said, if you have contracts that are still open but no further work needs to be done, you can consider asking your clients to close them or, if the client doesn't close them, you can close them yourself. Please, note that when you close a contract, the client is notified and will have 14 days to provide their feedback on the contract. If no feedback is provided on the contract by them, it will not have an impact on your score once this change is implemented.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/No-feedback-contracts-no-longer-impact-Job-Success-Score-JSS/td-p/824751

We will continue to update this resource page as we identify new resources and tools to support your business during this challenging time.We are here to help you with the documentation you may need to apply for assistance.Under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, individuals who have lost work may be eligible for unemployment insurance during the COVID-19 outbreak, even if they are self-employed as a freelancer or otherwise.If you are a freelancer and wish to apply for unemployment insurance and need proof of earnings, Upwork can provide you with a copy of any 1099-K or 1099-MISC form that has been issued to you.If you did not receive a 1099-K or 1099-MISC form from us for 2019 (we only send one when certain IRS criteria is met), we can still issue you one upon request. Just contact Upwork Support by going to the Help Center, clicking ""Get Help"" at the bottom of your screen.In addition, some small businesses that use Upwork as clients or freelancers may be eligible for a Payment Protection Program (PPP) loan or an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL).The PPP provides small loans to small businesses in order to continue to pay their payrolled employees, independent contractors, mortgage, rent, or utilities. PPP loans will be forgiven if used for an authorized purpose under the terms of the loan.The EIDL program provides loans of up to $10,000 to small businesses that are facing decreased revenue due to COVID-19.Upwork will provide any documentation we can in order to support your application, if you choose to make one.

It is my understanding that both would need access to the company UpWork account in order to join the UpWork message. However, the ""owner"" of the UpWork account does not want other people in the company (who may need to particiapte in interviews) to have access to the account. This is due to the fact that the company is primarily staffed by Freelancers. If the CEO wants another Freelancer to participate in an interview of a potential new UpWork Freelancer, the CEO does not want the current Freelancer to see the detail so the proposal of the person being interviewed as this may create conflicts internally due to pay rates, etc.The second challenge is that the interviews need to be scheduled for a future time.What we really need, is the ability to schedule a call with the person who submitted the proposal, the owner of the UpWork account and someone who does not have access to the UpWork account.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Zoom-Integration-on-Upwork/td-p/821163

We no longer have the outlet to interact at a local coffee shop or co-working space, visit friends and family, or enjoy our normal routines.This past year has required resilience from everyone in every part of the world. For most, we will continue to be challenged as we collectively pull through the pandemic alongside ongoing and emerging global events. While we can’t change what’s happened, we can provide some peace and calmness to reward your mind for working overtime this past year.We are dedicating the entire month of March in the Community to mindfulness to provide brief respites, bursts of joy, and to share mindfulness practices from around the world to help counter common issues like burnout. We know it doesn’t solve the big problems, but we do know we could all use a little boost in the practice of self-care.What you can expect:In our Coffee Break area throughout March, we will host live virtual yoga sessions and share weekly informative posts and discussions to help reinvigorate your mind!Every Tuesday at 7am (PST) and Thursday at 4pm (PST) during the month of March we will host live virtual uplifting yoga sessions led by Upwork Freelancer and Top Rated Talent, Natalie Thomas.

So the point is?I think they're now trying hard to keep the convo on the system instead of going on a different system. There's information other than the actual conversation that can help the platorm eco-system and understand the particular client / freelancer relationship. We call this ""QUANTITATIVE DATA"" in the biz. Also, by keeping it on the platform, the assumption is there's less likelyhood to continue doing things off the site.Example:If you were leaving your house, there's a higher likelyhood of you being outside. And if you went outside, It would actually take more effort for you to go back inside, so there's a chance you may just stay outside, even though you intended (or didn't) to go back inside. These are all fairly easy predictions/ assumptions/ logic statements to make, even though it doesn't apply to you. Unless you have access to widespread data, that proves more than your own anecdotal evidence, or feeleings, I would defer to Upwork, since they have access to ALL OF THE DATA -- except of course the data when people use other platforms. For that they don't have the data.This is obviously important to Upwork, since they're making this change.""You're missing the obvious point:The honest freelancers who stick to the rules would not communicate with clients outside the platform now.They are losing out to those who do not stick to the rules, which just also happen to be the ones most likely to take work off the platform.""I know you think that I'm missing your obvious point. And I think you're missing my obvious point. The fact is, if people are trying to pull people off the site, there's now more ways to detect patterns -- and they'll eventually get purged.You would have to either....1. Jump on a video call using the upwork system, only to tell client/freelancer you want to use another system, even though the call is going fine, which would be redundant and very stupid. I wouldn't hire you for sure.2. Write out that you want to hop on another system and get flagged.3. Take a token job, only to hop on a call on a different system to avoid a system that works fine. This will leave a track record of you doing $5 jobs and this will eventually blow up in your face, by probably flushing your JSS down the toilet.Upwork, doesn't want anonymous gig churners anymore like 5r. They want long term relationships. Hourly contracts! For people that support this, these changes are welcome.""Huh?

Again, it's easy to see why Upwork does this but couldn't they not pour more resources into making it smooth?

Frequently Asked Questions on TOS changes regarding information sharing and interviews,7/24/20 13:27,,768a9e90ab2c8219,ActiveMember,"You are free to use a scheduling tool that does not require the sharing of contact information. You may also use Upwork Messages to discuss and set up an interview.With so many exceptions already for times when it IS OK to share contact info when required for the quoting of a job, it seems like it is not a stretch to add the ability to use scheduling tools outside of Upwork, such as Calendly, to allow freelancers and prospective clients to schedule times to talk. Do you know of a scheduling tool that does not require email but somehow ties into your availability and sends an invitation to add to someone's calendar? It seems unlikely you'd find one that doesn't require some form of contact information. But using the Upwork messenger to go back and forth trying to set a time isn't a practical option and hinders the hiring process.My suggestion is that we be allowed to use Calendly (or whatever scheduling tool you use), and just as we would have to do in other cases where sharing email address is required for the quoting process (such as to get access to an admin tool), we remind the prospective client that all communication must happen in the Upwork tool. I mocked this up in my personal Calendly account to show a custom ""location"" of the Upwork Call option, and re-iterate that all communication must happen on the Upwork platform pre-contract. Yes, it requires an email address from the client to send a meeting invitation once they select their time, and reminder email for the call...but the messaging reminds that the communication will happen in the Upwork platform. NOTE: I'm not using this as I understand this is against the current TOS, but this is what I suggest be allowed.Example of Calendly SetupLet me give you an example of of a scenario I had this week:Applied for a job posted that would be multiple months/thousands of dollars of work. Was invited to interview. The client requested I send my availability to his email address. I gently reminded that the TOS had changed and all pre-contract communication needed to be on Upwork. I sent my availability and blocked the multiple times on my calendar since it isn't real-time scheduling). As the client appeared to be in a different time zone I included the times in both their time zone and my own (clearly labeled). A few hours later, the client selected the time (with the time zone identified) and then invited the two other team members to our ""room"" for the call. At the scheduled time (the next day), none of them arrived. They got mixed up with the time zones, didn't put the appointment on their calendar, and at least one likely just forgot. They let me know but have not yet rescheduled.Having worked professionally within sales and customer support for the better part of 20 years, I can absolutely assure you that having a meeting request that adds the appointment to your calendar, automatically at the correct time, drastically cuts down on missed meetings. Being able to schedule an appointment by looking at availability and picking a time is FAR MORE CONVENIENT for the client and the freelancer. This is no doubt costing Upwork money. They may not feel it yet, but it is coming as clients get frustrated using these tools. While as a Freelancer, we are in the system all the time and can adjust, many first time clients will just give up and walk away. In this case, one of the people scheduled to be on the call was a product manager for a very large and well-known software company. This was for his new startup. What are the chances he has time to deal with learning a whole new way to communicate and schedule appointments?",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-TOS-changes-regarding-information/td-p/756278

Frequently Asked Questions on TOS changes regarding information sharing and interviews,7/29/20 14:10,7/30/20 5:17,98c6414b69e5180b,CommunityLeader,"Team Upwork,My understanding is your team is looking for input regarding how you are approaching meeting the needs of scheduling. I have listed my thoughtsbelow sharing options I think would be very helpful for your team to consider regarding scheduling, as I use scheduling on a regular basis as a freelancer and appreciate the efforts your team plans to make to have a scheduling tool in place.Important Scheduling Solution for Upwork to Consider:Upwork needs to know which timezone the potential client is in and show the freelancer's availability in the potential client's timezone automatically, ensuring this is somehow clearly stated.The ability to pull availability from the freelancer's Google calendar(s) for availability is a must. Some freelancers have both a personal calendar and a work calendar linked in Google, and availability needs to be pulled from both (as a side-note, the security implications here slightly concern me, as giving Upwork access to our Google calendars needs to be handled with care, and freelancers need to be assured this data will only be used to pull availability). The freelancer needs to be able to set their general/recurring availability within Upwork, similar to ScheduleOnce Recurring Availability: https://bit.ly/2BLsKJW (Please search online for ScheduleOnce Recurring Availability, if this link doesn't work.)In addition to general availability, date-specific availability needs to be a setting within Upwork so freelancers can block out specific dates, which would override the general/recurring availability: Here's how ScheduleOnce does this https://bit.ly/2CRXRUN (Please search online for ScheduleOnce Date-specific Availability, if this link doesn't work.)Upon scheduling an appointment, the meeting should be added to the Google calendar of the freelancer, and the potential client should have the option to add this to their calendar too, via an 'Add to Calendar' link. Both the freelancer and the potential client should receive a confirmation email with the meeting details (There should be at least one line for freelancers to customize, even if most of the email is fixed).Since the meeting will be added to the freelancer's Google calendar as 'busy' time, this slot should no longer be available on the Upwork scheduling tool, since Upwork needs to pull from the freelancer's Google calendar as part of their availability.Reminders need to be sent to both the freelancer and the potential client via email (Not via Upwork's messaging tool; Otherwise, they'll likely get lost in the multiple pings a potential client gets with job applications, and just won't be effective. Pop-ups may be more annoying than helpful.). The intervals for when these emails should be sent should be customizable, and there should be multiple (for example, immediate; 24 hours before; 2 hours before, etc.)A link needs to be available to cancel the meeting if necessary. This should also cancel the Google calendar meeting and open the availability back up on the freelancer's calendar.There should be a threshold of how many meetings a freelancer wishes to take on in a day. After this threshold is reached, the freelancer's availability should be shown as 'not available' for that day. (For example, if a freelancer only wants to schedule 3 interviews per day, this should be an option they can set and not something they have to think about.)There should be a setting that ensures no 'surprise' meetings come up. For example, a sliding window that doesn't allow meetings to be scheduled within 2 hours of the current time (this should be customizable on a per-freelancer basis as the needs of many freelancers are different, and some wouldn't mind instantly hopping on a call or hopping on a call within the hour).The calendar should also have a sliding window of availability that doesn't let people schedule too far out into the future, and this should also be customizable by the freelancer. For example, only show availability for the next 7 days. (That way, someone doesn't schedule a meeting for someting next month before the freelancer has updated their availability and realizes they aren't available that day. As long as freelancers keep their availability for the next week up to date, they should be good to go.)Other systems, such as Calendly and ScheduleOnce have already thought through most of my notes above and additional scenarios I did not mention. I recommend having your team check the API documentation for these companies and consider how you may be able to tap into what someone already has built to reduce the complexity of what it could take to make a reliable solution.Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else. I'm also curious to hear what other freelancers would like to see in a scheduling appwhen thinking about this through the lense of what Upwork needs to provide.Thanks,Tim",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-TOS-changes-regarding-information/td-p/756278

Let's say a client and freelancer tries to use Upwork for a call and it didn't work well (e.g. bad audio/video quality). They still want to discuss a job, but time = money, so they need to choose another method to discuss the job right away. Is it worse case for an exception?And there are many more cases like this. And if a rule has too many expception, then probably it's a bad rule. Probably Upwork should just remind both parties that they have to use Upwork for payments, but shouldn't forbid communications.Or Upwork can 'invent' a new kind of (hourly) contract (only short term, up to 1 hour for example, with no feedbacks allowed, maybe with unchangable $0.01/hour rate etc.). And a client will send us an invitation to shart this kind of contract if he wants to discuss a job.I never charge potential clients for a short pre contract call (e.g. up to 30 minutes).

Action Needed for Freelancers to Update PayPal info,6/30/20 19:51,,6e5bb1b5a640b32a,ActiveMember,"Hello Upwork TeamI will share my opinion about this announcement. I do not know what is the objective of this new mandatory requirement in order to be able to withdraw funds to PayPal. The most I think of it the most I believe this is making no sense, matching the email addresses on both PayPal and Upwork should be enough.After more than two years as an Upwork member, and more than two years with an active long-term contract with more than 70K USD earned, I see this new rule as the biggest obstacle I have to face. I am from Venezuela and most of you know all the limitations we have to access other currencies different from the official one. First, Direct to Local Bank and Wire Transfer withdrawals are not available for Venezuela, and even if they were, the Government controls for exchange rates make it profitless. Then we have Payoneer, besides the actual Wirecard thing, it happens the same with the exchange rates using Prepaid Payoneer Cards here in Venezuela. Very few businesses know about and use Payoneer as a way of payment. Payoneer, the same as Upwork, has disabled To Local Bank withdrawals for Venezuelan users.So, even if it is hard to believe for some of this Community members, PayPal was the best choice for Venezuelan freelancers in Upwork to receive the money they have earned, using of course, the support of a third party (relative, friend, etc.). I have been able to get all my earnings for more than two years through PayPal and never had an issue or inconvenient. Now I cannot use it.I now wonder, should not be the main part of Upwork’s vision and mission to remove all barriers and borders? I think this new requirement is against this thought.In third world countries, like Venezuela, a lot of talented professional are wasted, Upwork has given clients the chance to exploit those talents and get the best performance of them and of course has given those talented freelancers the opportunity to get remunerations according to the their skills, and while Upwork do this gets a good profit.

For them, we can not allow them to have their own Personal Paypal Account as it'll create a lot of issues on the local front. However they provide individual services to the employers, still they work for the Agency and use the agency resources which make them a part of the agency actually. So, how do we confirm their Paypal Account as their Email Id is added as add-on account to the Paypal Business Account?I hope you can evaluate and analyse this situation in the real time working of any agency or firm. Like in Real Estate where there are many agents who sell the apartments for the company, but the actual selling is considered on the name of the Company and it is the company that receives the payment and not the agent.

Update to Invoices for Freelancers and Clients,2/12/17 7:03,,03c0a194cd143027,CommunityGuru,"Margarete,That's one of the differences between the US and the EU. The US will hold an individual accountable (e.g. a Swiss banker, VW employees) and thus blackmailing the company into paying. In the EU the company is accountable and not the individual. The moment they set up an office in the EU though, they are accountable. I've seen this happen with a company selling calling cards in the EU. They moment they set up an office in Düsseldorf the taxman knocked on their door. They closed the office within a week and brokered a deal with GB, then setting up their office there. And again, Upwork is not violating EU legislation, the freelancer is responsible for paying his taxes, not Upwork. Upwork is collecting the VAT on their commission, or reporting on it, if the freelancer has a VAT ID. That's all they are obliged to do. It's up to the freelancer and the client to work out how they will conply. And yes, their service of issuing invoices on our behalf is useless for us. With the access to the invoices we may have a bit easier to access information for writing our own invoices but that's all.You are right. But why is Upwork issuing invoices that at least cannot be used for those with a VAT-ID and introducing this as now ""complying with EU laws""? The only thing I want is a proper invoice. I got this on Elance and could use it for my VAT declaration. It is not very difficult to program an application. I do not expect from Upwork to forward any taxes for me. And yes, foreign companies circumventing tax legislations is a common problem.Nobody asks Upwork to care about our taxes but to provide invoices that comply with the tax laws. That could be expected for our service fee. If this is not possible, please do not issue invoices in my name, Upwork! Problems will arise as soon as a client from my country will use one of those VAT-neglected invoices issued in my name for his tax return.Well, we might ask Upwork for a discount on their fee as they provide only a part of their service to us. :-)",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Update-to-Invoices-for-Freelancers-and-Clients/td-p/299902

Starter Projects: Assisting new clients with their first job post,5/17/17 8:18,,81b84afc60afb6d7,CommunityGuru,"Hi everyone,This new feature is not to assist ""lazy"" clients or flood the marketplace with template job posts. It is meant to assist those new clients with their ""first hurdle"" when starting on Upwork. We can track metrics on the number of clients who register and of those, the number who post a job. We'd obviously like this percentage to be as high as possible, as this would bring more jobs onto the platform for you. And instead of having clients post vague job posts with little description of what they're looking for, or budgets that are not in line with the scope of a project- we're trying to help.We frequently hear questions from clients in Garnor's new client webinar on posting their first job on Upwork- How should I set up ajob for X? What do I need to include in the description? What is an appropriate budget? What should I be providing to the freelancer? etc. These templates are not general and are tailored for a specific job, for example a WordPress website created- the deliverables and requirements areoutlined off of what is involved when creating a WordPress site, along with a proposed budget inline with the scope of the project. The client can always edit and change information in the post, although some may not. The job posts will have enough information to know the scope of a project, and as you currently do when applying for jobs here, when interviewing you can ask questions, discuss the project and go over proposed milestones you outlined in your proposal (for fixed price).Lena,If I may ... I'm going to copy Wendy's suggestion, because Wendy won't mind, and it's been overlooked for too long:What buyers need is a check list of items to include in their RFPs. The items for each category will be different. U. would be more than wise - and reap cash bnefits - from having providers in each cat. supply you with what items are a Must Haves.There are a few basic bits of information from each category that clients could be directed to fill in. These bits of info would go a long way in helping us determine if the job is a good fit, or is of interest to us. Of course there is no way to cover all scenarios - but there are items that do apply to all jobs.Vague job posts are not fun, nor profitable for Upwork.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Starter-Projects-Assisting-new-clients-with-their-first-job-post/td-p/337449

It is meant to assist those new clients with their ""first hurdle"" when starting on Upwork. We can track metrics on the number of clients who register and of those, the number who post a job. We'd obviously like this percentage to be as high as possible, as this would bring more jobs onto the platform for you. And instead of having clients post vague job posts with little description of what they're looking for, or budgets that are not in line with the scope of a project- we're trying to help.We frequently hear questions from clients in Garnor's new client webinar on posting their first job on Upwork- How should I set up ajob for X? What do I need to include in the description? What is an appropriate budget? What should I be providing to the freelancer? etc. These templates are not general and are tailored for a specific job, for example a WordPress website created- the deliverables and requirements areoutlined off of what is involved when creating a WordPress site, along with a proposed budget inline with the scope of the project. The client can always edit and change information in the post, although some may not. The job posts will have enough information to know the scope of a project, and as you currently do when applying for jobs here, when interviewing you can ask questions, discuss the project and go over proposed milestones you outlined in your proposal (for fixed price).",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Starter-Projects-Assisting-new-clients-with-their-first-job-post/td-p/337449

One distinction that I'd like to bring up is the difference between feedback and reviews.I would hope that when a freelancer enters a new contract that part of the communication with the client is ongoing feedback to ensure that the job and the quality of the work is on track and in accordance to the client's expectations. Once I've worked with a client for a while, we understand each other's expectations, timeframes, accountability, questions, etc., and communicate on an ongoing basis. When I start a new contract, I make a point of initiating that conversation if they haven't done so already.On the other hand, a review serves a different purpose, to assess our work throughout the life of a contract and wrap it up with the stars ratings, comments, etc.I'm not sure whether what appears to be a public review can really serve the purpose of ongoing feedback between the freelancer and the client. However, having the ability to provide a mid-project *review* on a long-term project that can be applied to our JSS can be a very good thing. I would hope that on the off-chance that a misbehaving client wants to use that as inappropriate pressure on the freelancer, that can be suppressed from the JSS.Just a couple of thoughts.

Expanding Job Search Filters,10/12/20 15:00,,ea77300489d46400,ActiveMember,"Hi Valeria, yes I understand that I can have multiple searches and they will all feed into the job feed. The problem is, I often want to use other features of the filter, often temporarily.For example, one search strategy I use since I am new and handicapped with not having much of a job history and other profile stats, I often check the “less than 5 proposals” box just to look for jobs that not many other people have bid on. I probably have a better chance at those. But I don’t want that to be permanent.I’m pretty sure (haven’t tested it yet) that I would have to check that on each separate filter in order for it to work as I want it to. Then I would have to uncheck it on each filter to get rid of it. And the same for any other option I want to try. As I said before, an unwieldy mess. That’s why it’s preferable to have a single filter.The frustrating part of all this is that I can make a guess as to why this happened, that is a feature that existed previously was removed. I have been around a long time and I have seen this before. I have probably been guilty of it myself. I call it the lazy designer/programmer syndrome.What I’m guessing happened is that the previous filter was in a big box with plenty of room, so there weren’t many restrictions on space. With the new design everything was moved over to the left hand side of the search, and suddenly space became a premium. So whoever did this started looking at the mechanics of how to select job categories, they realized it was going to be difficult to navigate around and make selections in that amount of space. It wasn’t going to be a problem to make a few checkboxes in the subcategory areas, but navigating around the entire job category area would be difficult. So instead of doing the work to try and figure out how to make it happen, they just dropped the feature.Anyway, I appreciate your help. I’m pretty sure whatever I say isn’t going to make any difference so I guess I will start experimenting with multiple filters and see if I can come up with something that is half way workable.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Expanding-Job-Search-Filters/td-p/812085

However, I would doubt that anybody withthe sort oflingusitic excellenceconferred upon him/herby Duolingo, would have sufficient expertise in a language to call him/herself a native speaker or writer.When it comes to translation, there are only a handful of people who are truly bilingual (sometimes trilingual)whoare capable of translating(grammatically and idiomatically)into a language that is not their mother tongue.

If your have received several (3 or more) of these ratings, the badge can appear on your profile. As mentioned in Option 2, this is a more complicated process because the badge will be dependent on a combination ofa) the self-selected proficiency level you set in your profile settings; andb) several of these ratings.So technically, client's feedback can affect your English Verified badge both positively and negatively which is why we recommend pursuing the first option if having this badge is important to you.Avery",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/English-Verified-and-change-to-language-proficiency-labels/td-p/128637

Do you have a copy of the previous terms somewhere?Tyler, you can have your own default contract with terms to your liking. Upwork's default contract is called ""optional"" for that reason. But it's opt-out rather than opt-in. The way to opt out is to have the client agree to your own terms; those terms will then supersede the corresponding terms in the Upwork contract. If the problem is as you originally stated it, you could change exclusive to non-exclusive for your own contract.For background, though this is not my area, there have been many disputes between contractors and clients over the nature of deliverables for technical work. As in the case of its interpretation of copyright, Upwork has published terms that overwhelmingly favor the client.

It's about a problem that has persisted for years despite all the other improvements. It's bothered me for a long time, but I haven't mentioned it before as it's minor, but it creates a slightly unprofessional appearance, so I'm sure you'd like to correct it.Ever since I've been using Upwork the final section of our profiles has been titled ""Other Experiences"". This is not correct English. It should be ""Other Experience"" (singular). The word ""experience"" has two very different meanings depending on whether it's used in a countable or non-countable sense. My experiences (plural) are things that have happened to me. That's not the correct sense in the context of the profile.Incidentally, this Upwork help page refers to the section as ""Other Experience"":https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211063188-Create-a-100-Complete-Freelancer-Profile",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Did-you-notice-our-new-look/td-p/847868

As Mastercard hasaddressed and fixed some technical issues, your Payoneer Prepaid Mastercard is now active once again.We know this period has been difficult for you and we appreciate your patience and support while we worked to get it resolved.Can I access the funds on my card?Yes, you can withdraw the funds on your card from an ATM or spend them online and in-store. While you may wish to quickly withdraw your funds, the FCA has assured us that no further problems are expected.From 00:01 CET on Monday, July 6th, you will once again be able to withdraw your funds to your local bank account and use the Make a Payment and Manage Currencies services. Until then, we will waive the flat ATM withdrawal fees.Can I receive new funds to my card?All future payments will continue to be received to your Payoneer currency balance, not your card. Even though the FCA announced that the cards are safe to use, we will offer a new card issuer soon to ensure the long-term safety of your earnings.Will I be able to request a new card?We will contact you as soon as we have a new card solution available.We apologize for any hardships caused by these events. We appreciate your continued partnership and remain committed to strengthening our offering with additional secure ways to access your funds.Why did the FCA originally freeze card activity?As you may have seen on the news, Wirecard AG filed for insolvency. Your Payoneer Prepaid Mastercard Card is issued by its subsidiary, Wirecard Card Solutions Limited (WCSL) in the UK. The FCA, which oversees WCSL, decided to restrict WCSL’s activities to protect customer money. As a result, there was a temporary freeze in place on all card activities in effect. It was lifted today after they completed their audit.How did Payoneer handle this situation?We worked around the clock to pressure the FCA to lift the freeze as soon as possible. In parallel, we ensured that all our customers could continue to receive new payments to a Payoneer virtual balance and withdraw those funds to their local bank account. In addition, we stated that even if the FCA audit found a shortfall, our intent was for Payoneer to fill the gap so that our customers got 100% of their money back. Our customers will always be our first priority, and we are committed to transparency in our communications.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Payoneer-Prepaid-Mastercard-Concerns/td-p/774379

So now all the people who have money in Payoneer actually have them blocked at third party wondering if FCA will lift the measures for card holders to do withdraw, or we are f..d. And there is a third option thaty the money might be back to Payoneer but until they don't send new cards, well, it is a long wait.Since it occures that it is known for a week for the coming problems, it is a shame that neither Upwork, nor Payoneer warned people for the incoming disaster. I'm pretty sure they knew what's comming and the missing warning is giving me bad ideas why they did it.Time will show what will happen.

Today, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which regulates WCSL, issuedrequirements on WCSL, freezing all prepaid card activity for the time being. We believe that cardholder funds are properly safeguarded and that the freeze will be temporary.What does this mean?The FCA has communicated that they have taken these measures with the primary objective of protecting the interests and money of Wirecard customers. Pending further actions from the FCA, you will temporarily be unable to withdraw the funds on your card, nor receive new payments onto your card.Any funds that are in excess of the maximum balance of your card are held by Payoneer and are therefore not impacted by the FCA’s temporary freeze.How can I get paid during this time?Any future payments that you receive from marketplaces, platforms and clients will not be affected by the freeze.You can sign into view your funds, and you can now add your bank account for withdrawal of your future incoming payments.We are actively working on offering additional options for you and your patience and understanding are highly appreciated.

VAT Charges for Belarus Freelancers and Agencies,2/6/19 20:35,,d6140618d296f29b,CommunityManager,"Starting March 1st, Upwork will begin charging VAT on our fees to freelancers and agencies in Belarus. A Value Added Tax law was introduced in Belarus which applies to fees charged for electronic services from non-Belarusian businesses (like Upwork) to Belarusian consumers.If you are a freelancer or agency on Upwork who is operating as a separate legal entity in Belarus, Upwork will not charge you VAT. To confirm whether or not you are a legal entity, we will begin asking freelancers and agencies in Belarus to enter their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). We will be notifying all freelancers and agencies in Belarus via email. You will also see a notification when logging in.For freelancers and agencies that have entered a valid taxpayer identification number for the legal entity, Upwork will verify your TIN and will send you an email within 3 days letting you know if the information has been validated or declined. If validated, Upwork will not charge this tax and you will see “VAT Reverse Charged” on your invoice. For freelancers and agencies using Upwork as an individual entrepreneur and not for a legal entity, a 20% VAT will be applied to the fees we collect beginning March 1st (e.g. Upwork service fees, membership fees, or purchases of additional Connects). Per Belarusian law for digital services, the 20% VAT will be added to the applicable Upwork fees and will appear on your invoices as one bundled fee. Here’s a simple example of how it would work, assuming the a 20% Upwork service fee:Your contract amount$100.00Upwork service fee (including VAT)Upwork’s service fee is $100 x 20% = $20 E-services VAT to be paid to the Belarus government by Upwork is $20 x 20% = $4Total fees including VAT is $20 + $4 = $24 -$24.00Take-home earnings after service fees and VAT$76.00In other words, considering the example above, the user will only be charged VAT on the $20 freelancer service fee, so 20% of $20 means they will be charged $4 for VAT. These amounts will appear on invoices and in your Transaction History and will be calculated in U.S. Dollars.If you have questions regarding your tax obligations, please consult your tax advisor. For more information on Upwork charging VAT, see this help article. For more information on VAT laws in Belarus, see here. Let us know if you have any additional questions.

I sent the client a quote on it yesterday and have already done a consultation with him.Two things tend to make freelancing difficult for me here: most clients want detailed, individualized quotes for free before they will award a contract, and my proposal close rates aren't where they need to be. In other words, I give away something of value (the quote) but - in many cases - am not paid for the several hours of work that go in to creating it. So if I were to upgrade from Basic to Plus, it would be with a definite business goal: improving my close rates.Knowing who the other candidates are would be a great step toward that. I could use that not to discredit other candidates, but to explain to clients why I would help them achieve a better outcome.That was available in Elance, and I'm willing to upgrade my membership for it. But it is not available anymore on Upwork, as a live chat with Support today confirmed.

It now makes it difficult for some of us to properly evaluate whether or not to submit proposals. The main reason for me is because quite often there are jobs posted for North American freelancers only butmany foreign freelancers don't take the time to fully read the job title am/or proposal apply even though they have no chance in getting hired because they are not in the preferred demographic. Now we only see the number of proposals and not the location of those who have applied. Now if we see 20+ proposals or more submitted we have no way of knowing if we are wasting our time and connection credits by applying or still have a chance if we are in the preferred demographic.

They should definitely NEVER change this!First of all, it keeps the privacy of the users - private. Why would you have to check on others profile? That sounds sneaky and very unprofessional.I would't want you or someone else to see where I have placed a proposal and I don't want to let you ""research me"". It's my privacy where I bid and should be my choice, not yours.Also, its an disadvantage for users who sent bids early and don't want to sneak on other users first before they place a proposal.You should just read the Job description carefully and send your proposal with your rates. If client feels you are the best for the job and rate is reasonable for him, then you will be selected. But there is no normal reason checking on other users.The only reasonable and helpful research is by conducting it on the client. Check his job history, award history, total paid amount, average paid amount. And you will have a clue what he usually pays for that work. And based on that you can send your price slightly lower. Price will be within the range and you can impress him with your professionalism.But clients will not chose you for a slightly lower price. They would rather chose the best one over a slightly cheaper one. But if the price difference is big, then it might change it.But you can't research another company or designer that is biding on a project. It is the same as if you want to go into another ones office building and search through things there. It's thame same if a local client to whom you have sent a proposal will make all the bidders public.This also causes partly the problem that users steal your content and portfolio from your Profile.I don't feel comfortable other users to have access to my profile. The only one that should see it, is the clients where I place my proposal.And, if you want to know how many proposal a job has, that is still there.Maybe including a total average amount, would help some users.Maybe there should be an option if I want my name to be seen by other users on the Proposal list or If I want it to be hidden, like it is now. If I select visible, then I can check other visible users as well. If I want to be anonymous then I can not see other bidders name.That would make both parties happy!But I till think it is not right checking on others!",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Changes-to-how-Upwork-displays-proposal-count/td-p/177922

Upwork is changing website design and some terms time to time. Like Job success rate has been replaced with old job success score procedure.

Now nobody can check where is my No in the applied candidate and exactly how much candidates has been applied for this job. In my point of view It is not good enogh to hide these proposal counts from Applicants.

Seems pretty clear to me that Upwork suffers from one or both of the following problems: 1) a resource/budget crunch to run the infrastructure smoothly 2) a 'fragile' codebase Case in point, the Reports tab now updates every 30 minutes. This must be a recent change since I remember the time when it used to update in realtime. The Stats is designed to update once every 2 weeks, many large websites don't resort to that low a frequency. The manual hours logged take an hour or two to show up. All of this suggests trying to limit backend operations. That has been the tenor of the changes. Some new bugs have cropped up too. Over the past week or so, in a couple of jobs, a milestone recently approved, showed up in both the 'Review' as well as the 'Pending' tab. I've gotten the 'abnormal levels of traffic' errors during my day i.e. US/Europe middle-of-night Clearly, some gears are out of place.Upwork isn't going to come out and admit to these issues, but I don't think there's any hidden business model planning behind these changes, just impromptu repair or brakes being applied and some thin PR bandages laid on top.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Changes-to-how-Upwork-displays-proposal-count/td-p/177922

I believe this is especially a barrier to potential clients that are new to Upwork and just checking it out.So what happened with the prospective client I mentioned at the beginning of this message?

This Upwork bot sends a message to say that if we communicate outside of Upwork's systems before a contract starts, my account will be terminated.This morning I wake up to message and invitation notifications on my cell. I click on one and the page can't be displayed. I get an error. I've seen countless times where the messaging center won't open or is down for maintenance over the years so I make a point of not relying on it. However, now it is a rule?The reason I'm creating this post is because not only will the notifications give me an error screen when i try to open them, but I just tried Upwork's own calling system and it didn't work well enough, so the client dropped the call and asked for another way to continue the interview. However... that is not allowed.Thoughts?I'm frustrated because my experience with Upwork's communication systems have been that's it's consistantly unreliable and now I see this new rule that forces us to use it on the threat of account termination.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Improvements-to-Voice-Video-Call-Feature-in-Upwork-Messages/td-p/732813

Clients ask me to send them a meeting dial-in. I should be able to provide them with a phone # and a meeting ID or passcode, or URL to click that they can share freely with their team members to join. This is VERY COMMON for almost all conference systems. Upwork treats calls like a phone call in a group chat thread. I understand it is similar to conferencing, but the devil is in the details, and Upwork's solution for group calls is not consistent with conference systems clients are accustomed to. As such, clients attempt to circumvent because they just want an easy way to communicate.Please allow me to give clients a phone # and a passcode to access meetings.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Improvements-to-Voice-Video-Call-Feature-in-Upwork-Messages/td-p/732813

I'm using Chrome on Windows 10 if that matters. Now I'm trying to deal with the impossibly tiny screen which occupies less that 1/6th of my screen makes it impractical for the contractor to show me what is on his screen. I click on the icon in the upper left of the screen hoping I will be able to see the contractors screen at my full screen size, but it only gets ridiculously tiny. The contractor had no idea how to make the view full screen. I even shared my screen with him but he could not see how to make my view full screen although he evidentally had the capability. I understand only recently Upwork banned us from meeting on Skype or Hangouts.

If it does, I would welcome your replies, as I am sure others will to. I stayed away from commenting on anything other than work (i.e. mortage payments, dwindling food supply, childcare, etc.). So, without further ado . . .Dear Ms. Brown,My name is Robin, and I have been a faithful freelancer on Upwork (formerly oDesk) since January 2011. I have worked10,405 hours to date and have referred countless of capable contractors and employers in need contractors to the platform. I truly do value the opportunity to work for your company from home.That said, I would really like to know what was meant when an Upwork staffer typed ""We are here for you- COVID-19 Update"" into the subject box of this string. I ask because this has been my experience . . .Covid-19 is a tricky illness. You get it, are sicker than you have ever been, and recover (or so you think you have). I contracted Covid in early March but continued to work, as I was able, not wanting to disappoint my clients. I got somewhat better, not feeling 100% but managing. At the beginning of May, Covid tossed me another big surprise with apulmonary embolism in my lung, complicated by pneumonia for which I was hospitalized. Prior to being admitted, however, I did change my Upwork status to unavailable until May 30th, even though I was unsure if I would ever be home to work from home again.(Please bear with me, as I do have a point.)I had some great doctors and nurses and was released late last week more than a little concerned about the business to which I was returning. I honestly was most concerned about my annoyed clients and the hundreds of emails awaiting me in my inbox, but it never occurred to me to be concerned about my standing with Upwork, as I had done everything I should have done, right? Wrong. I came home to my account being suspended because I did not reply in a timely manner to have my identity verified for the 5th time during a pandemic when my profile was paused.The closing of your message asked the community to let Upwork know if there is anything you can do to help. I would like to suggest putting a stop to suspending accounts during this pandemic for frivolous reasons, such as identity verification, especially if the freelancer has been working for you for 9 years. For my part, when I do not look like an extra on The Walking Dead, I will schedule yet another verification interview.Thank you in advance for your consideration.Sincerely,Robin M.**Edited for Community Guidelines**",**Edited**,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/We-are-here-for-you-COVID-19-Update/td-p/719217

My comment referred to what would happen if they created an entirely separate platform for U.S. workers since the U.S. freelancer seems to be the scapegoat for several things that don't go right on Upwork. Oh I know, we would probably still be targeted and there would be the accusation that all the good jobs are on the U.S. platform.Why do you insist that the US freelancers have a blame, are targeted or are accused of something? You are manipulating the conversation to make something else out of it. I was talking about Upwork's actions.Point is that Upwork's communication goes like ""We are here for you ... we've created a Relief Fund for the U.S. freelancers"" .... and for the rest of the platform we've got plenty of empty words of compassion.It doesn't make sense to open a micro website for a market that is proven to generate less then 30% off your entire operations, and that is interconnected to your other 70%, unless you create a bridge to allow either side to switch between global and local.... it just doesn't make sense.

Your response, though, did offer a more detailed mindset of those that may feel slighted.Sometimes, I feel like those who complain target U.S. freelancers too much and not focus on the fact that Upwork is a U.S. company. Being in the United States, it may be easier for Upwork to navigate the laws and policies within this country more so than in other countries. Upwork has said that it is trying to work with other countries to offer support. It doesn't guarantee that anything will come of it.I often feel the Upwork community is pitted against one another which is unfortunate. I wonder what would happen if Upwork ever decided to create separate websites for U.S. freelancers and everyone else since it seems that we are the target of ridicule all of the time.I don't think there are many people that come here in the forums and brag about their leaving, they just move on.Point taken.Where did Upwork say they are trying to work with other countries to offer support?It was either in this thread or another. I can't remember. Too many threads on this topic.""it may be easier for Upwork to navigate the laws and policies within this country more so than in other countries"" ... whatever, it's no rocket science to donate to Red Crosses.Yes, but if they donated to the Red Cross, it can be done anonymously. Another thing, other are looking for direct relief. There would be complaints that the money should have been given directly to the freelancer. It doesn't take rocket science to see that scenario playing out.I wouldn't expect Upwork to offer support on an ""individual"" case. It would be overwhelming if not impossible to offer help in the same manner to other countries because there are many categories in a vulnerable situation regardless the existence of a pandemic or not.""I often feel the Upwork community is pitted against one another which is unfortunate. ""Ummmm, if that happens, what could cause that .... a fund relief like the one Upwork founded could be a reason. Upwork is a U.S. company with a global community.The U.S. clients already have the option to post a job that only US freelancers can apply to. If the client already has a preference and knows exactly what he wants I think that is good he has this option.Yes, but that option is still housed on the global platform.

I am not asking if we can forgo payment protection, I can already do that by not utilizing it. I am asking if it is possible to allow freelancers to opt out of payment protection in exchange for a reduced job rate. I'm not sure how the numbers are set up, but it appears that payment protection is subsidized by all users. If there is a smaller user base covered by payment protection insurance then maybe Upwork could pay less and be able to pass the savings on to freelancers? Why should some freelancers have to pay an insurance premium for something they don't need and will never use?It was just a thought and I would be surpised if it amounted to any significant $ amounts anyway.How will you get paid more just by omitting payment protection? You agree on a rate with the client. Upwork will not increase this rate just because you do not care whether you get paid in the end nor will the service fees be reduced.

Expanding Specialized Profiles for Freelancers,3/2/19 12:47,3/2/19 13:50,b2004b4dadf96a9c,CommunityGuru,"So, here’s my short story about specialized profiles:Since my invitations fell to literally “0” (zero) I made two specialized profiles to try the new feature. My first thought was this is not specialized enough. Illustration but what kind? Digital? Hand drawn? Children’s book? I make digital illustrations but I can’t draw a stick man if my life depended on it. I don’t even have image editing as an option while nearly half of my jobs are image editing. So I put my editing jobs to Graphic Design category. One of my profiles was showing 1/10th of my total earnings, which I guess is as designed. That made me unhappy but I kept the divided profiles. To be able to see the effect of my new profiles I started to check my stats every day and it says “You replied to 4 of 4 invitations to apply in the past 90 days”. Still not getting any invites what about profile views; how many prospective clients discovered me this week? “0” (zero). What? Why? I came to forums to see If anyone else is experiencing the same thing and then I learned that everybody and their cousins have 0 (zero) views.Now I want to ask you, how I can see the effectiveness of my new profiles if the only statistics available to me is malfunctioning. Since I started asking, why don’t you add sub categories and let us choose what we want to specialize in, instead of giving us two very broad options? Maybe I want to write novels as my second specialty. Maybe I am a prolific editor in my B&M life and want to bring that to the virtual table. OK, let’s forget about writing, I have a lot of 3D modeling jobs completed with flying colors in my history but I don’t have 3D modeling as a specialization. In Turkish when something happens rarely we say once in 40 years… Once in 40 years you introduce a new feature that looks promising and this time you implement it so badly that I took both of my specialized profiles on hold for the foreseeable future.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Expanding-Specialized-Profiles-for-Freelancers/td-p/536669

I'm having an issue where all of my reviews are shown on my main profile but most are not shown on my specialized profile. I only do 1 service so the only reason I made the specalized profile was because Upwork made me have it to submit to some jobs in that category.

However, since this feature was enabled we saw that freelancers with specialized profiles are 30%+ more likely to receive invites. With a specialized profile freelancerscan more effectively highlighttheirstrengths and market their services to clients looking forspecific expertise.Thanks for acknowledging my question Valeria, but that's not a very reassuring answer. Where can we leave feedback on this feature? It would be very unfair to force this on us in future. In my particular case, I can't (and don't want to) be any more specialized than I already am. Most of my clients don't hire me for just one type of project, so it would be very limiting if I'm pushed into dividing up my profile and categorizing my skills/services.Like Wassim, I want everything to be in one place for my clients, who need to be able to quickly see what kind of work I do. And given the types of invites I'm getting, clearly many clients are not even paying attention to a single freelancer profile -- what makes Upwork think they'll go through each freelancer's different sections?Edited to rant a bit more: can we not focus on more important things like attracting more high-quality clients and jobs to the site? The quality of proofreading/editing jobs posts has been increasingly horrible since January, and I haven't even found one decent project to spend my connects on this month.

We understand that many of our users do not just have one service, one specialty, but have several specialties and want to be able to highlight all of them. As an example, a freelancer may be a graphic designer but also a copywriter or translator. Currently, the way profiles are laid out, all of your specialties and expertise are combined into one area, one general profile. Freelancers asked for a way to change this, they shared that setting a rate on their profile was confusing because the rate would be different for each of their services offered. Their overview, portfolio, etccouldn’t be tailored to each speciality. And clients may be deterred from anexcellent graphic designer, if they saw mostly translation jobs in their work history.We have heard great feedback from freelancer and clientsaround this feature and future rollouts to other categories.As our understanding of the different types of work getting done on Upwork grows and changes, we'll continue to expand this list in Design and Creative.

GST for freelancers/agencies in India,12/3/20 3:51,,8bf59744f6ae0a82,ActiveMember,"Hi , I am registered under Indian GST and have GSTIN.As we know from 1st Oct,2020 Upwork charging TDS on Gross amount client pays.Also we are paying service fees in USD and get separate invoice from transaction history section , do we need to pay GST on Service fees and membership fees paid by us to Upwork?Before TDS , accounting was done as net off from what client pays and what we pay to upwork.Example:Before 1st Oct,2020 if client pays $100 , Upwork deduct $20 and we book revenue of $80.Now after 1st Oct 2020 , Upwork charges TDS on Gross amount which is $100 that means , Indian Govt will get the reporting of income from Upwork as Mr. X was paid $100 and for that , TDS was charged $0.75.Based on what upwork will show to Indian Govt as our turnover would be $100 coz they have deducted TDS on that. If we net off the charges paid on upwork then our turn over would be $80 which will be a mismatch in records. So if we show $100 as our turnover and shows $20 paid to upwork as Fees , it should be considered as import of services and will be liable to pay 18% GST on the same.This is my understanding. Can you anyone please help if this accounting is correct or not?Thanks",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/GST-for-freelancers-agencies-in-India/td-p/690390

My Accountant is also cheating me.(i) What if the transaction is above 60,00,000 INR and you are freelancing with foreign clients.(ii) The basic idea of GST is that - when a client pays money for the service he has received, he will again get back this amount. For this, the client has to provide a GST number. There is also TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) which is applicable only in India. I have done it many times.

Without reading the explanation here I would have assumed this meant that the client indicated they wanted new proposals rather than UW simply guessing that they do. It's misleading. At best what I get out of this is that maybe the client is still engaging with their posting but that's about it.

(But make sure we now it's re-posted/the client is still looking for propsals. Those jobs are actually very attractive because it signals to me the client is usually looking for the chepaest, or best freelancer.)I imagine the reason why they don't want to move the job up again is that this is something clients can do if they choose to Feature a job, and that is not for free.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Open-to-new-proposals-badge/td-p/826976

An interctive calculator of complete job fees would also be great. For example here under the table it says very discretly that freelancers ""only"" pay 10% fee in Business plan, while clients pay 3% with the firts two plans. If a client has not alredy studied freelancers fees, this is so confusing. It does not say how much is already charged on freelancer side with Basic and Pro. So anyone who want to have a complete cost of the job, has to find the freelancers pricing table on the very bottom of the pricing page. Ironically clients have this No Surprise headline on their pricing page, while they will most likely miss the entire picture about the total cost of a job that is mostly on freelancers shoulders1. Starting at 20% + (2% in some cases) - pretty high fee unproportionally affecting specific categories of jobs (for example design comparing to programming)2. Now introducing fees on bidsThere should be a one page that clearly states, what Upwork charges both on freelancer and clients side and under what circumstances.

You are reducing our hard work on some badges just so you can hide somehow the failure to help the newbies. I mean really, if this is just to be funny then no thank you. I don't have that time to spent on such useless options. Sure, yes you can change all you want, its just a profile, and honestly, all Clients have tested us from the beginning as they do not trust you or the profile you are showing to them. Hate me all you want, but you haven't made it easy for all of us. So to speak I have to share my hard work with the newbies because you think is better this way. You didn't help us when we started working. We had to bust our butt to get her where we are, and now you are reducing our so-called Top Rated badge to some random evaluation just because we do not spend much more money on buying your services? Interesting. And stop putting the Design and graphic design profiles as a model because we from the marketing won't have it seen like this on our Profiles.

And now this section became even smaller. 3 thumbnails instead of 4, thumbnail size was decreased significantly. Portfolio became a small subtle line at the very bottom of the Profile page. I wonder who is beneficent of this update if it doesn't work well for freelancers nor clients. ""Good job"", thanks.Also, it looks like this update's purpose is another attempt to force specialized profiles for the Design & Creative freelancers. But the main problem is that these specialized profiles don't work for us. Most of the time instead of one great profile you get 2 or 3 small and weak specialized profiles. And that works badly not only for freelancers but for clients. And for Upwork in general. Because instead of a team of pros with great profiles a client will see a lot of non-reliable persons with a couple of complete projects in one particular area.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-Freelancer-Profile-Layout/td-p/781854

New Freelancer Profile Layout,7/22/20 4:29,,934a2bcea1b2b8d4,ActiveMember,"What the ...?Why does Upwork keep making these changes without any kind of extensive research through the ACTUAL freelancers? I never got any kind of notification that this is an upcoming thing, and this isn't a minor touch-up, but a complete revamp of the MOST IMPORTANT part of your Upwork account.Besides this lack of communication, I don't see it so much of an upgrade because of several reasons:- price is now on top and 2nd thing you see (after your headline) - so Upwork's intention is to compete with Fiverr on all the low cost jobs? Is price really the most defining part of a freelancer's experience? No top freelancer would ever compete on price - with this change, we'll just basically start a price war amongst ourselves.

I have refresh it over and over but it's all still blank, please help.You can't, it's at the bottom ""by design"".Hi Maria,Thank you for your feedback! We customized the layout for Design and Creative Specialized Profiles to have portfolios displayed at the top because we have learned how important portfolios are for Design and Creative talent to be able to showcase their skills and experience to clients. We know that portfolios are less important for other categories so we didn't make this customization across the board. We are continuing to learn what is important for different categories of work and will continue to consider updates that will help talent market themselves in the best way and win more work!Hi Cary, thanks for following the thread and providing some answers. As someone whose general category is Design, my general (All work) profile is also in Deisgn, and I imagine that's true for quite a lot of the niches that rely on visuals. The general profile has the best stats (earnings/# of jobs), and the fullest portfolio. I rely on it a lot more than on the specialised profiles, and to me it makes zero sense to have the portfolio only on that one all the way down, where few people will scroll to see it. Please consider moving the portfolio secition up for all profiles (and niches) - it's already been made small enough that it won't push the Work History section too much below the fold for profiles in fields with low portfolio impact. The size is already a disadvantage for all categories that rely on visuals, at least eliminate the position disadvantage. Or, at least add an option for users to rearrange/customise the order of the right-hand sections under the title and overview.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-Freelancer-Profile-Layout/td-p/781854

I know this because the duration of each call appears in my message list for a project after each call related to that project is over.This VOIP or Zoom usage time already being tracked by Upwork should automatically be added to each project's database of work time that now includes a) properly documented TimeTracker-tracked time and b) manual time, if I decide to add any.There should be no need for me to invoke TimeTracker for these calls.And I should not have to move my mouse or use my keyboard during these calls; there is also no need for screenshots.A client cannot contest such work time tracked by Upwork - Upwork only tracks these time segments when both the client and I are on a call. If one of us leaves the call, the tracked time for that call ends. This leaves no room for a client to contest whether I was working on his/her project for a specific time period if Upwork's own records show that I was on a call with the client at that time.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Zoom-is-coming-to-the-Upwork-Marketplace/td-p/814216

While I am a ghostwriting freelancer who actually does try to report prospective clients seeking to commit academic fraud, the process to report it is considerably more time-consuming that flagging. For years, too many other freelancers on this forum (besides me) have expressed a similar perspective on the lack of the ability to specifically flag academic fraud. If UpWork does not take a stronger approach to decreasing academic fraud, it is really aiding such fraud. After all, students clearly know that their chances of finding an unethical freelancer to write their required reports is probable if they simply persist. Over time, the problem has gotten worse - and not better.

Once I learned about the feedback button and realized I could shrink posts that were not relevant or I was not interested in, it made reviewing much easier as the ones I did not want and had already seen were collapsed, so I could easily ignore them. One thing I did notice that runs counter to what Vladimir stated was that I can scroll past collapsed jobs and see new ones that were not present when I initially viewed the feed. This tells me either more were added after I reviewed or they are not in order by time. It would be great if you could add a means to toggle visibility of collapsed postings. That way I would only see either jobs I was interseted in and had not collapsed or new jobs that I have yet to review. I did view a video about customizing the feed but do not see the ""Add to Job Feed"" button/link in my search windows.

Direct Contracts new beta offering.,4/24/20 2:16,,c485dee7b9619adf,ActiveMember,"Thanks for your reply, Vladimir.From your post it sounds like you're referring to a different, Bring Your Own Client program. Note that the process you described above, with sharing instructions with your client on how to hire you as a freelancer is unfortunately incorrect. The client, who must be new to Upwork, needs to sign up using the BYOC invitation link you receive from our Customer Support team, in order to qualify for this promotion. I see our Customer Support team provided on your open support ticket on Wednesday the personal link and detailed instructions your client needs to follow, have you shared this information with them?I have shared all this information with her, and it was a frustrating process for her to follow. It easy for you or me, but clients are finding it complicated. A 2-minute video would do wonders in this situation, is all I'm saying.1. Please refer to the screenshots and information Lena posted in this announcement post.I went through the process on my side, I saw all these screenshots while I was sending a direct contract. I was asking how the process looks on the client's side.2.Thanks for your question. Since your client and you will only be using Upwork for payments, by design any Direct Contracts will not impact your Upwork reputation metrics (for example your Job Success Score or Top-Rated status) nor be included in your other Upwork profile stats, such as total earnings, number of jobs, etc.I am aware that the direct contract will not affect anything at the moment.

That would be even better than what I suggested!

But from that point forward, much of the Upwork system is somewhat clumsy and even a bit non-intuitive. More than once I've had to coach new clients through the hiring process. I've had a few Upwork clients lament about the complexity of using the system, even to the point of them suggesting that we take our relationship outside the system. (a request i always of course decline.)I'm not here to complain. I know that nothing's perfect, and overal my experience with Upwork is tremendously positive. I just don't see the value of bringing a contact I've made outside of Upwork, into the Upwork system?Removing payment holds is attractive, certainly. But I have my own billing system where i'm paid within 24 hours (or immediately, for a fee WAY less than 3.4%) from payment of invoice.

I don't work with people outside my own country, why would I want to be paid in another currency (outside what is already done via upwork)? Why would I want to wait 2-3 days for payments to hit my account when they are processed automatically?Let's say the cost of this direct connects costs me approx $50 AUD a month if I brought all my clients over.

Highlighting Top Talent to Quality Clients,2/10/20 10:55,,eb53bc29c9fef260,AceContributor,"Here is my idea of how you can better value top-rated freelancers. Or at least not to insult them.Top-rated freelancers (or those with some level of earning) should not pay for the connects.While buying the connects is not a big fee, we are already paying a lot on fees with existing contracts. This is like paying for the job of sourcing and finding new contracts. Moreover, new contracts are already charged with higher fees. I understand the reason for price on connects - I am fine to filter out spammers and make bids more relevant. But well-established freelancers do not need this filter. We do the filter ourselves on a huge amount of postings, checking the briefs quality, credibility and billing history. We have to bid carefully only on jobs that seem to be promising.While Upwork is putting new fees for everybody, this particular fee is kind of insult to the hard work of those who are here even longer than Upwork itself. Just remove this for freelancers with certain earning or ratings. This would be a more palpable sign that you value the work of top-rated freelancers, rather than some update to the portfolio tools on the platform. This is not a very needed thing.Otherwise, this connects are like a low-cost airline policy, when they are charging even for the seat number to survive in the market.

I agree that some quality freelancers are undoubtedly being turned away, and an application fee would actually help to address that. Currently, liars and con artists who game the system are being rewarded with auto-acceptance of their profiles, while people who are honest about their abilities are less likely to be accepted.

Highlighting Top Talent to Quality Clients,2/1/20 9:16,,acd4bf43e5fcbdab,CommunityGuru,"In 2019, we heard from some of our top talent - experts in their fields and committed Upwork users - that they would like additional ways to stand out on Upwork. They especially want better access to quality opportunities from quality clients, mainly from businesses that have large, consistent projects. We’re excited to let you know that in 2020, Upwork is committed to moving forward this vision and will experiment with various ways to make this possible. Our team’s roadmap includes ideas like:Leveraging experts to assess talent in specific categories (e.g., graphic design, UX/UI design, software development, etc) I don't expect this will pertain to my category (marketing research), which is pretty small. But I'm curious: who will the experts be, and how will they be vetted? (Like others, I've had pretty appalling experience with the Talent Specialist program, so I hope this question doesn't surprise UW.)Creating additionals tiers to identify talent that has received great feedback on large contracts (e.g., $10k contracts) or has achieved a certain category-specific threshold in earnings on Upwork (e.g., $30k)Will there be a chronological limit on this? Will contracts fall out of the consideration window, as they age out of the JSS calculation?Allowing freelancers to post testimonials from past clients; and conducting checks to verify those testimonialsAutomating profile creation so that new talent can easily add their past work historyTotally don't understand the rationale for this. It seems to me it is already far too easy for unqualified and unprepared individuals to create profiles.Automating portfolio uploads from BehanceAnd much more!We will begin testing the first two ideas above soon. The initial tests will be short-term with limited participants to inform our future direction. When we have improvements that are ready to be rolled out to a broader audience, we’ll let you know.So far, I do not have confidence in how UW conducts these ""tests"" of new features.

We would love to hear from you on this topic and would particularly like to hear from you on these questions:What type of work do you do?How could Upwork help clients identify top talent in this type of work?What are your goals as a freelancer or independent professional?If you could wave a magic wand, what would a typical week look like for you on Upwork? How could Upwork better help you achieve that success?Thanks!Iliana Montauk, Product ManagerI specialize in primary marketing research, i.e. querying customers and prospects via surveys, 1-on-1 interviews, focus groups, etc. I offer turnkey projects as well asad hocservices such as questionnaire review, data tabulation, analysis, and reporting. I also do some business writing (blog posts, white papers, etc.).I don't do secondary research, e.g. scoping market opportunity, building lists of prospects, etc. Most helpful to me would be clear sub-categories within Market & Customer Research that separate primary research from secondary.My goals are to earn a living, and to spend most of my work time engaged in tasks that make the highest and best use of my skills and capabilities.My 'magic wand' week on UW would include 10-20 hours working on one or more good-fit projects; and at least one invitation from a good-fit client with a viable project; zero invitations from Talent Specialists trying to connect me with irrelevant projects (or worse, ones that are fairly obvious cases of academic fraud).UW could help me by:- cleaning up its act re. onscreen messaging and pop-ups (get rid of awkward, misleading language); - stopping the implementation of, frankly, stupid policies (forcing the creation of specialized profiles by FLs who do not need them and are hampered by them, not allowing a FL to choose which specialized profile is displayed to a client opening a proposal, attaching foolish and interfering icons to profiles (e.g., rocket ships, fires)- effectively vetting new FLs to stop the flood of unqualified, ill-equipped, unprepared. Doing this one thing would have a ripple effect, as UW would not then have to spend resources trying to contain the damage. You could stop designing and implementing policies geared to the lowest common denominator.

In B2B beta testing, testers are briefed on the intended and expected behavior of any changes, and there is a protocol for feedback.Beta testers know that new features may not be fully or smoothly implemented, or work as expected.They sign up for testing despite that risk because they want to give feedback on and influence the shape of evolving software.Upwork's version of A/B testing is: If we live in California or New Jersey (earn x dollars a year, have green eyes) the system will work for us this way. If we live anywhere else (earn <>x dollars a year, have another eye color), the system will work another way. But we don't know that. We are assigned to a test category at Upwork's discretion. Upwork does not discuss the workings of the test, and may or may not announce that a feature or protocol is being tested.

I heard every piece & they're clear to me: the frustration with JSS going down when a project of yours was open for a long time without billing, people positioning themselves as grant writers when they don't have the level of experience you have, etc.Could you share some examples of invites you're receiving from clients or TS that are wasting your time, as well as some jobs that you would like to be invited to?Invitations from TS and clients that are actually relevant to my skills and to the size project I actually work on. A small project is approximately $1000 to me, and I don't consider projects at less than my rate. Sending me invites that are below my rate or desired project size are just wasting my time and the client's.So my level of experience is set at Expert and my hourly rate is visible. I often get invites that are below my hourly rate or below my expertise level. It's pointless to send a proposal to someone who can't afford me. So I'd like TS to stop sending those invites. If a client did it, I'd presume that they had seen it didn't match and that they would consider my hire rate.Also, before I basically removed every skill but my main one, even though I have those skills, I'd get invites for other kinds of writing that weren't related to what I do. I modified my skillset, even though it's less now, to avoid those unwanted invites.I'd like to get invites from clients interested in projects that will typically last more than 3 months and also that are actually eligible to win a grant. Out of all the clients who come seeking grant writing services, only 1/3 of them are actually eligible to receive a grant. Similar to Mary's distinction about being a paralegal, for-profit companies do not typically receive grants (yes, SBIR is an exception as are some others) and people don't typically get grants to buy a building to open a laundromat or deli or whatever. Late night TV has filled their heads with garbage about free money...I'll end my rant on that here. What would help is doing something to get clients to put a little more information in their job description. I'm not even interested in saying what they are required to put, just somehow getting them to write more about their project. What industry? What region (this is actually important because some regions have more funding than others)? How long have you been in operation? Honestly it's not even that it has to be super long. I've had plenty detailed descriptions come in 2 sentences, because they hit the right specifics concisely.I don't know how to solve that problem, Iliana, but it' s the reason I often skip postings that possibly could lead to a lot of money and likely clients never hire anyhow. I had one client who had a vague description and I was just curious. She said no one had responded and hired me. She turned out to be my biggest client on Upwork, around $5k to $6k, and she won $1.2 million grant. Which leads me to another suggestion: some of us do long-term projects, finish them, but then the client doesn't see their ROI for months. I'd love some of my clients who won money 9 months after we submitted the grant be able to leave that feedback.Hope this clarifies.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Highlighting-Top-Talent-to-Quality-Clients/td-p/696475

I got 2 contracts closed in quick succession this week.However, I can't help wondering why the same regard being shown the client in being warned about the impending closure of account cannot be extended to the freelancer as well. Take the case of a freelancer like the contributor (sorry, lost your name) who says his client is in some part of Asia where logging onto the site is often problematic. The contractor may have a different way of contacting the client (maybe a text) if only he gets to see the warning on the 'inactive' contract.And as you can see there is the issue of unpaid dues.Besides, a contract cannot be what it is without the participation of both parties. Why then favor one over the other with information, and not just information, but crucial information? Yes - I mean those warnings.Something else: Some clients are so organized they know what contractor does what for them in what season. So what may seem to Upwork like a long time of inactivity (3mths) may, in effect, not be long for the parties concerned - both the contractor as well as the client. Can you imagine a client who has 10 long term contractors each of whom updates a set bunch of websites for them in regular intervals of, say 3 - 4 months.All that organization is put to naught by this one 'rule of 3' and the client has to do fresh rehiring each time.

Closing Fixed Price contracts with no activity,7/20/15 18:29,,5231dc6cf77a2850,CommunityLeader,"If there is no activity at the 90 day mark, Upwork will close these projects and notify freelancers. At the time of this closure, the client is again notified on the site to leave final ratings.I was in contact with the client this afternoon, and he told me there is no opportunity for feedback at the closed contract.But let's summarize the whole operation. It could have a deep negative impact for same freelancers, and all Upwork says about this is ""Deal with it""? I'm impressed, very impressed. I don't know which kind of business the management is developing, but I thought I know the core of the existing business. Upwork sell the service, delivered by freelancers, and a lot of top freelancers, to the clients. This business works, because most of the clients are satisfied with the service they receive and are willing to pay for it. In fact the clients bring the money to the platform. They are willing to pay for the best service, which is promoted by Upwork. And what happened in the recent month? Applications of freelancers are hidden by a mystic algorithm, that decides the ""compatibility"" of certain freelancers for a job, and no one know how to apply for a job without being hidden by a robot. On the other side clients getting recommandition with freelancer that not match to the requirements of the job. Means matching freelancers are maybe hidden, and the client is frustrated by the recommendations.Next the JS. Overall I think it is not a bad tool, but the sufficient information, how the freelancer can maintain the JS is missing. A lot of the current Top Rated freelancers are working with excelent feedback since several years, and now they are working with the fear they could lose this badge. Every new client could be the one that takes your badge, espaciacaly if they are new clients without history and feedback. I personaly don't apply, if a client has no feedback, but hey, there are many existing clients with a large number of feedback. And what happen? The feedback of the client disappears.Now you damage the profile of many freelancers by closing inactive contracts without any announcements. The longer they are working at oDesk/Upwork, the harder they are hit by this smart operation.There are many other things, but I don't want to list them all. They are all listed in threads here in the forum, and you need a lot of time, if you want to read them all. So what's the result of all this? Freelancers are disapointed, and if they cannot deal with the situation, they will look for other opportunities, certainly many of the current top rated freelancers. For clients it will be more and more difficult to find the best freelancer for their jobs. Either bcause too many of the good freelancers are gone or because they try the quality recommandations with disappointing results. Finaly the clients will do the same like the frustrated freelancers. Existing clients will leave after long time of satisfied collaboration with oDesk/Upwork, and many new clients will leave after their first try.I really hope things will change, because I started my career as freelancer at oDesk and I don't want to leave, but I have the impression the people who are planing the progress are runing though a tunnel with an abyss as exit. Maybe this is just because there is no information what's the direction, what's coming and what's the goal.

Rememberabout 1 year agoon upwork / oDesk there was no Escrow or Dispute system for fixed contracts.Why is that all the time WE FREELANCERS have to pay the price, when connects were introduced there was a promise that there won't be spamming from clients but They ARE STILL clients who spam around.More than 10 contracts of mine ended some of them were people who never cared to respond to us or pay us and now we are going to pay for these fellows by losing our reputation I'm now a TOP RATED service provider but the next JS score calculation will show me no where.Please take a leaf from the book of other outsourcing / freelancing platforms they charge or over charge the freelancers but they don't comeup with this JS kind of things that makes freelancing a risky business.THANKSPS: Seriously YOU Think some one will hire me if he sees 10 'no feedback given' decorative stars / badges on my profile.

I joined Upwork recently namely due to the simplicity and transparency of the docs related issues Upwork had been known for prior to this change.Unfortunately, having familiarized myself with the details of the subject, I see no signs of that simplicity. The idea of forcing freelancers to fill a separate contract for each of the clients he works with is so bad that it entirely kills the idea of freelancing and of the platform itself. Freelancing platform by definition is a place that should simplify relations between outsourcers and workers, not complicate them.For example, a freelancer earns $1000 in a month with 5 clients, 150 – 250 usd with each. Do you really expect him to fill up 5 “ConfirmationofServiceAgreements” and 5 “Acts of Acceptance” only for the purpose of completing one single withdrawal? Each of these documents will require to recall the exact sum he had received from each of the clients, the exact commission he had been charged (as you know, it differs from contract to contract depending on the total amount earned).All of this leads to absolutely unreasonable amount of paper work.More than that, it is literally senseless, as the client doesn’t sign any of these documents. And the freelancer is free to fill in as many or as less clients as he wants (per each withdrawal). What legal power may these documents have?In this topic alone it has been mentioned several times that you have translation issues in the contract body and yet the last version of the doc still translates “Ukrainian” as “Русский” in the language section and has all the same problems with the fields’ sizes.I believe, all these facts reveal it to be a very unfriendly policy towards Russian residents and something needs to be done about that.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Russian-Freelancer-Documentation-for-Wire-Transfers/td-p/248545

They can literally just fill out a ""contact form"" and get in touch with you -- isn't this what we all do on our websites anyway? ""Hey, leave a name and a message and I'll get back to you""?C) When the client knows he's sending a direct message to a specific, real person, chances are they'll actually write a whole lot more details about their project than they would bother to write in a job post. They most likely won't just send ""Hi, this job was posted from a mobile device, sorry for typos.""As for opt-out, I don't get why you'd want this option. Isn't your goal to be contacted?

Feedback on the new Upwork Team App,11/18/16 1:29,11/18/16 1:34,788faecde2915f38,ActiveMember,"Hi Ivo, you wanted to hear comments.I already tried to use your new app more than a year ago, but it was a skeleton of a program with no features, so I rolled back.Since I received message that the support for oDesk Team app will be discontinued this week, I decided to install the new app once again. So far I observed the following issues:- I still cannot adjustthe length of snapshot preview or assign a custom sound that is loud enough for me to hear, like in oDesk app.- The hotkeys only worked for one day and then just stopped working. They are still assigned and enabled, just do nothing when I press them (then need to be disabled and re-enabled in order to work).- I can't adjust the size of the cache. That's why the very next day after installation I woke up to see upwork site down, and time tracker cache full. Had no such issue with the previous version, thank you for my lost time/money.- I had to clear out some suspicious screenshots that should have not been in the tracked activity. Not sure how they got there, it might or might not be a quirk of the new app. Time tracker issues are both the most serious and hardes to spot/filter out, and I don't want to spend my own money on testing those.- I sent a support ticket #16869420 and got a reply, but they didn't write back in more than 24h after my response. I imagine they are quite busy with other customers that are exploring the new app. Anyway, the support will not be able to increase my cache size or add features to the app, so I'm not complaining.On the plus side, the visual design has improved significantly and the messages feature can be hidden.So my question is: can your team give me the URL to download the previous tracker version?And my comment is: your new application is definietly not ready to be rolled out. Its current state after a year from releaseis somewhere between ""major letdown"" and ""disappointment"", it is still functionally a beta version. Please give it more time and use it to test out the bugs and add the crucial features, like cache size increase. Meanwhile, let us use the old tracker.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Feedback-on-the-new-Upwork-Team-App/td-p/138095

Feedback on the new Upwork Team App,1/26/18 23:52,1/26/18 23:54,d92a506f7956ca2b,AceContributor,"Vladimir, I would respectfully disagree. I've done several Linux consulting projects through Upwork and not one time has my clients, or their end clients, ever used Ubuntu. It's been RHEL or CentOS (the majority of them). The problem is that your developers are basing what to provide to us by looking at what's popular on the desktop, especially for other developers, and not what's popular on the server side, which is where the jobs I look for are. In my 19 years of experience in IT on the infrastructure side I've only encountered Ubuntu once on a single test machine. It's been RHEL or CentOS with a smaller number of companies that use SUSE Enterprise/OpenSUSE (although those were absolutely huge deployments). Unfortunately, things that work one way under Ubuntu simply don't work the same way or aren't compatible (particularly libraries) under RHEL derivatives (including Fedora) and if your clients aren't using the same distro or a compatible distro and you're trying to test some things in your own environment before doing it in the client's environment you can end up with some serious issues costing you money, trust, and ultimately you can end up with a client looking at the whole Upwork experience skeptically.Also, oDesk did maintain a repository of older releases of the team app for a long time.

[…]Ivo, please allow me to disagree: this is far from being the fairest way.I always thought that I could rely on the time tracker for accuracy. But now, each time I finish work I have to check my work diary and make sure to delete time that's been over-tracked.So, basically, what your sentence suggests is that Upwork is comfortable with leaving it up to the freelancer to assure that the time he/she tracks is accurate. I don’t think Upwork should be relying on the freelancer’s honesty to “amend” something that’s broken. It’s clear that if the freelancer doesn’t collaborate then the cost of having an app that doesn’t track time accurately is ultimately going to be paid by the client.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Feedback-on-the-new-Upwork-Team-App/td-p/138095

Now sometimes one is doing pair programming with designer as per the project requirements. In that case a message can pop up or anyone can access that messages from the app. There can be so many messages that no one would like to share with anyone due to security reasons. But through this app everything is accessible and is not even password protected. If you are logged in to app then anyone can access messages and read very secret conversations with clients like payments, projects, emails, some important credentials or it it could be any thing important.Now don't you think thattracking app should only be for time tracking and not for messaging functionality. Now a simple example is:I logged into my colleage machine for providing some work to client with tracker on and later signed out. My password was saved in that machine for time tracking app. Now with saved credentialsone canlog back in to the app and you do not want to delete credentials either so if there comes any need of work you can ask him to login and track it. Now witholder version no one can access any information even after logging into the app. But with this latest version anyone who logged into app can access messages which is something no one would like.There can be a case that we have a very special client and our client wants to design a special logo. We have designer available and client wants to track his time as well. In that case he has to login to track. Now in that case our messages and our communication, rates and everything would be visible through messages which no one would want. Because the reason is that everyone wants to facilitate his client but no one would ever want to share the important and secret information with other people.I feel this is high security concern. This is one reason one may not want to switch to latest app and neither would want to lose clients. I think tracking app should only be for tracking purpose and even if you think you are facilitating a user with adding messaging functionality then it should be password protected everytime.

Feedback on the new Upwork Team App,12/1/15 9:33,,b16b6ce06d1f9adf,CommunityGuru,"Most importantly - I need the day to be measured in MY timezone, not GMT. In the late afternoon in the Western US, when midnight passes in GMT, all of a sudden the the time total for ""Today"" resets to zero, giving me minor panic attack! I understand the work week is measured in GMT, but it should be a simple thing to display my work times in mylocal timezone, and keep the daily time totals consistent, with a cutoff on Sundays when the work week ends.Secondly, random screen shots tied to time worked are just wrong. Often a four-hour session will be over- or under-billed by 10-20minutes. SometimesI'll be waiting and waiting for one last screenshot before I can turn it off to make sure I get credit for all the time I've worked. Sometimes I turn it off early and work another 10-15 minutes to make it even out. This kind of discrepency is NOT accurate to say the least! 10 minute increments arefine as a concept, but in practice,some of those incrementsare 3 minutes and some are 18.And two more minor items:I would like to see Messages REMOVED from the tracker - I find this feature useless and that it bloats the app.Having to ctrl-click in the menu bar is also ridiculous.

It is true that the tracker is a lot nicer and has many other features. However when Upwork giveth, Upwork also taketh.Why werethe screensnap and editing features removed? As we speak I currently run both versions just to be able to use this irreplaceablefeature. I cannot see why the feature had to be removed. Do you know why?Now to the main problem that has plaguedall version of the application - Time Tracking.It is true that based on probability and statistics, that both freelancer and client shouldlose/gain time/money at the same rate which will eventually even out (not on any one contract). But doesn't that sound silly? Why should this be the case? Why is it set in stone? With all the many revisions, noone thought of fixing this problem? Or noone saw it as a problem? Do you know why?Why is the logging of time (in 10 minute intervals) linked to screenshots? Random screenshots are necessary of course, but why is it linked to time logged? This is the main and only reason why there is a problem of losing time/money in the first place. Why cant both things operate separately, like a normal tracker? This is not rocket science. The tracker can log time in minutes (like a normal clock) and then have a random screenshot anywhere in the 10 minute span as normal. I really don'tsee why this is so hard to understand? Do you know why Ivo?These are some serious questions that I, along with many other freelancers need answered. You are the man who requested the questions. This is not something difficult, or negative - it is progressive. Time worked = Time paid, simple.I eagerly await your response.-Setu.Edit: Thanks to Olga for making me aware of this thread. I need to now start visiting this section more often.Edit: Now that I think about it, the feature that I am requesting is actually already present, just overridden. If the tracker snaps at 10:56 and you stop working, there will be 6 bars in the activity section. However if you continued until 10:59 even after the snap, there would be 9 bars.So why does Upwork bill in segments of 10 mins, when they already track per minute? Why not bill accurately? Now it makes even less sense why this practice is continued. It needs to be stopped.And I am not being overtly negative against the brand, I am stating a genuine concern on behalf of freelancers and clients alike.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Feedback-on-the-new-Upwork-Team-App/td-p/138095

This is a great way to showcase your expertise and knowledge.What We’re Looking For:Articles must be original content created by you or on behalf of your organization. They should be relevant and engaging to our audience and explain topics clearly and succinctly.Articles about technology trends, new software languages, or business insightsThought-leadership pieces that demonstrate subject-matter expertise.If you are interested in contributing to this area send us a PM to share your idea.Also, we have decided to retire the Regional Groups area of the forums this week. These boards do not receive a lot of activity and so questions posted there are often unanswered by other users and helpful information is unseen. The threads that were posted in the Regional Groups area will be migrated to relevant boards.Let us know if you have any questions.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-Resource-Corner-in-Community/td-p/742305

Upcoming Changes allow Freelancers to Edit Milestones,6/6/20 5:21,,990669075c17c592,AceContributor,"I used this feature for the first time to add and edit milestones on an ongoing contract a few weeks ago. This week I went to edit the milestones for a different contract (after the client and I spoke about it and added more work) and the only option available was to add a milestone, not edit the existing one. The client also said that they couldn't edit the milestones or budget (or maybe they just didn't know how).

Interested in trying out a new beta feature on Upwork?,8/22/19 10:15,,8a1e2f23ce094537,ActiveMember,"Upwork seems to be trying to simplify things that cannot be simplified.As another freelancer mentioned, projects are big or small, and even the size or number of pages may not mean much to what a rate must be. Unless I want to add dozens of projects, there's no way for me to communicate the breadth of the work I do and the potential charges, and without reading a client's description of their work and/or seeing a sample, there's no way for me to say whether I'll charge 10.00 or 25.00 to edit a thousand words. I don't want an author who I'd charge 200.00 to pass me over because they think I'd charge 2,000.00. Simplified as it is, this is going to give clients the wrong impression about how much professional work costs, and put me, for instance, in the position of having to explain to a writer that their writing isn't as strong/clean as another's, and therefore the rate is much higher. That's an unpleasant, unnecessary conversation which wouldn't even be broached if there weren't a base rate on my profile.I've already deleted the ""projects"" (two of which I didn't do/don't do) that were placed on my profile without my being asked.

Interested in trying out a new beta feature on Upwork?,8/30/19 7:53,,e8ef04ae4c4b1e60,CommunityGuru,"Upwork seems to be trying to simplify things that cannot be simplified.As another freelancer mentioned, projects are big or small, and even the size or number of pages may not mean much to what a rate must be. Unless I want to add dozens of projects, there's no way for me to communicate the breadth of the work I do and the potential charges, and without reading a client's description of their work and/or seeing a sample, there's no way for me to say whether I'll charge 10.00 or 25.00 to edit a thousand words. I don't want an author who I'd charge 200.00 to pass me over because they think I'd charge 2,000.00. Simplified as it is, this is going to give clients the wrong impression about how much professional work costs, and put me, for instance, in the position of having to explain to a writer that their writing isn't as strong/clean as another's, and therefore the rate is much higher. That's an unpleasant, unnecessary conversation which wouldn't even be broached if there weren't a base rate on my profile.I've already deleted the ""projects"" (two of which I didn't do/don't do) that were placed on my profile without my being asked. I sincerely hope that this won't become a feature of profiles that's mandatory. If it does, that may very well be the last straw that causes me to leave the site.I have a sinking feeling it will become a mandatory feature soon. I've also deleted mine; the feature doesn't apply to the kind of work I do, and I can only hope that Upwork doesn't force it on us.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Interested-in-trying-out-a-new-beta-feature-on-Upwork/td-p/634898

Interested in trying out a new beta feature on Upwork?,8/22/19 19:16,,2cf28176505885bd,ActiveMember,"So I guess for the past few days my profile said I was offering services that I don't offer for prices that I don't offer. I do think that offering ""gigs"" simmilar to how Fiverrr works is a good idea and I did quickly edit mine so people are not mislead into thinking that the default ones ore real.My question is can I add delete or re-arrange the order?Again, I do like the idea but I want to give some feedback on the exicution... To just add this LIVE to peoples profiles and just guess at gigs and prices is not optimal 2 reasons.#1 the frelancer may not want to offer that service or price or want to use this feature and your going to put someone in a really aqward position if they get a message asking for said service / price combo.#2 If a client is searching for a freelancer and every page they go to has the same generic ""I'll make you a logo for $50"" there going to ignore it after they see it a few times because there going to relize that the section is a default feature and it will have a negative effect on freelancers who want to take advantage of the new feature.Giving freelancers a message making them aware of the new feature and encuraging them to turn it on and use it, then promoting the ""popular projects"" to clients searching for them seems like it would have a more desirable outcome for both client and freelancer.

Upcoming test to display hourly ranges on job posts,5/17/19 12:36,,c862c0aed76ee995,CommunityGuru,"Hi Wendy and Eve,I understand your point. Question, when searching for jobs on the platform, are you finding that clients are posting jobs in your niche at the hourly rate you're looking for? At times do you bid on jobs that may be lower, and explain why your hourly rate is higher in your proposal?Im asking you feedback on these, because this hourly histogram is meant to assist/provide guidance to clients who may not know what budgets are for their job. A client may know the end product their looking for but may not know the mechanics of how that is created. I can see this occuring in your field, Wendy, marketing and branding, a client know what they want but not whats required to make that happen.Providing some education/guidance with what a budget could be for a job will hopefully prevent many of the jobs posted in this Coffee Break thread with the unrealistic budgets:https://community.upwork.com/t5/Coffee-Break/Crazy-Job-Postings-Part-II/m-p/394821#M32062%3FAgain keep in mind this is a test, so when you do start to see this treatment when submitting proposals let us know your feedback- if the budget-range is too low, too high, if you're seeing jobs priced more accurately and less lower budget jobs- which would be good.Hi Lena!I don't really understand your question. Until this test a clients can just choose $, $$ or $$$ when posting an hourly job, so what budget they have isn't clear at all. However, I wouldn't apply for a job marked with less than expert level.When I do send a proposal for an hourly job I tell them approximately what I deliver within one hour if they ask in the job post or invitation, but sending long proposals with a lot of details about these kind of stuff I usually don't do, as I would rather talk about it during an interview.I also assume giving some sort of average word count per hour, or other deliverables, is easier for me than for others. The work I do is more or less the same for all clients, and within the same niche, so I can easily estimate more or less what they can get from me.Also, for me I think I'm already at some sort of disadvantage, as my niche and language is a very narrow one. Actually, there is not a single other freelancer who has the same experience and language as I have on Upwork, so when a client compares my rates with other freelancers they can see already that I'm more expensive, and I don't need Upwork in addition to point this out to them.I would also like to add that what I see in job posts is that clients very rearly add all the skills they need, which I assume would throw off an algorithm. Say a client just chooses ""writing"" and ""Norwegian"", which is common for the jobs I would be interested in, the average rate I would assume would then be set by the average for all Norwegian writers who has chosen ""expert level"" in their profiles. So then all freelancers who charge extra for additional expertise would most likely be above ""average"".I know I'm not a good example to use for this, as other freelancers with more competition in their niches would be worse off than me, but still the same applies. Freelanceers with a high hourly rate will be at an disadvantage. And, I wouldn't want to lower my rates just to come off as a better fit for Upworks algorithms (and I'm guessing that wouldn't be beneficial for Upwork either).Sorry for the long post, I just had a lot of stuff I wanted to say.

(I have never bid on beginner level designated jobs.)B) I'd say 90% of my bids get at the least a response from the buyerC) Because a conversation is started (written or via U. chat or comparablevenue) I can explain the multiple facets involved and why they must all sync to make the project workFixed Price Jobs:I simply bid what I feel the job is worth. I bid double the stated budget a good portion of the time and have bid triple the budget more than a few times. Again, because a conversation is started (written or via U. chat or comparablevenue) I can explain the multiple facets involved and why they must all sync to make the project work. End result - I've landed the jobs despite being over the client's budget.FYI, I'm highly selective in accepting invites and even more so in blind bidding and am rarely asked to lower my p/h rate which I openly tell clients is how I calculate fixed job quotes.Our concern is two fold:When U. puts restrictions on the top end of rates (in any category) they areunconsciously placing restrictions in the buyer mindThis also stymies our ability to explain why multiple skills are needed as buyers will never get beyond why our rates are higher > they will unconsciously think we are trying to scam. i.e., they won'not read our explanatory proposals.Hope this helps.Suggestion based on Eve's 2nd post.

It sets an unrealistic expectation for clients if they think they're going to get top-notch expertise at such a low rate.Also, if these generic dollar amounts apply across the board, regardless of industry/field, that's another huge disservice.

Partnership with Veem to Access SBA Paycheck Protection Program Loan,5/20/20 17:05,,d6140618d296f29b,CommunityManager,"In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Small Business Association (SBA) has recently introduced a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which affords forgivable loans to small businesses in the US to pay their employees during the COVID-19 crisis.Small businesses, including sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed persons are eligible to apply. Still, finding someone to speak to about qualifying for government assistance through banks has led people into long waiting queues and spiraling internet searches. Once deciding to apply, navigating through the application processes for government relief assistance loans can also be confusing.To help US-based talent and clients apply for the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, Upwork has partnered with global payments platform, Veem.Veem has joined with several partners to give you have a better chance of getting your application submitted early, with less waiting time, and with a more streamlined and guided approach to submit your application. Visit the Upwork/Veem partner page to start your application.Veem’s multi-lingual team is available 24/7 to answer questions as you prepare to complete your application - just email sbahelp@veem.com. After completing your application, you should receive a confirmation email from Veem with a link to your application status within 72 hours of your submission. We will not be able to view the status of your application on our end, so please follow up with Veem if you have any questions.We’ve addressed some of your anticipated questions below. You can also find more information about financial resources on our COVID-19 resource page.Who Can Apply?The following entities affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19) may be eligible:Any small business concern that meets SBA’s size standards (either the industry based sized standard or the alternative size standard)Any business, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, 501(c)(19) veterans organization, or Tribal business concern (sec. 31(b)(2)(C) of the Small Business Act) with the greater of:500 employees, orThat meets the SBA industry size standard if more than 500Any business with a NAICS Code that begins with 72 (Accommodations and Food Services) that has more than one physical location and employs fewer than 500 per locationSole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed persons500 employees, orThat meets the SBA industry size standard if more than 500Can you tell me more about loan forgiveness?According to PPP, the loan will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities (due to likely high subscription, at least 75% of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll). Loan payments will also be deferred for six months. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the government nor lenders will charge small businesses any fees.Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring workers and maintaining pay levels. Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines, or if pay decreases.Why should I apply through Veem instead of my bank?While there is no technical difference between the PPP loan that you can apply through Veem and your bank, Veem has joined with several partners to give you a better chance of getting your application submitted early, with less waiting time and a more streamlined process to submission of your application.Why is Upwork partnering with Veem?Upwork is doing this to help out both clients and talent on our platform during a turbulent time across the United States.Can I apply for PPP if I am not a US citizen, but my business is located in the United States?Unfortunately, Veem’s banking partner has confirmed that they are not accepting applications from businesses that aren't owned by US citizens. However, there is language in the legislation indicating that the loans should be available to non-US owned businesses if they operate in the US and employ US citizens. We recommend checking with other institutions processing PPP, as they may be able to process your request.What is the status of my application?We are not able to view the status of your application on our end, but you should receive a confirmation email from Veem within 72 hours of your submission. This will link to the status of your application and you will receive a checkout email once it has been approved.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Partnership-with-Veem-to-Access-SBA-Paycheck-Protection-Program/td-p/750825

Removing Skill Tests on July 16th,8/6/19 18:57,,b3414a5396ccbff3,Moderator,"Hi Mary,I'm sorry to learn that this experience has inconvenienced you. Please know that while the skills tests have been removed, the Upwork Readiness Test will remain. As Lena noted on her post on this thread, the“Tests” link in the navigation bar will be renamed to “Upwork Readiness Test” and direct straight to the Upwork Readiness Test page where new freelancers will also find links to read our Freelancer Manual and watch videos in our Education Hub.I also checked your account and can see that your visibility has already been set to public.If an established freelancer doesn't earn money on Upwork for 30 days, their profile visibility will automatically change to private. This is checked daily, not once a month. If you aren't regularly earning on our platform, your profile may be set to private, even if you submit proposals and interview frequently. There are different ways of setting your profile to public again, one of which is contacting us directly so that we can set your profile visibility to public. If your profile is set to private again after 30-days, or sometime in the future, check out the options listed in the email notification or in the pop up on Find Work page to set it back to public.You may read more about this in this help article.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Removing-Skill-Tests-on-July-16th/td-p/609790

You already have a work logging tool - It should be used, and of course you can't stop someone from cheating on a different device like that; but instead of wiping the tests of the earth for everyone convenience, you could do the job properly and allow testing conditions such as Cisco, Microsoft and many others do around the world.Boo Upwork",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Removing-Skill-Tests-on-July-16th/td-p/609790

As someone who is on the client side and hires contractors, seeing someone's scores are a valuable data point. There are numerous ways people game the system in Upwork (get a bunch of friends to give them 5 stars, or quit projects that they do poorly on so that they don't get the score counted).The tests showed some level of skill and effort. What was valuable was if someone scored poorly more so then if they did well. Even if the tests are outdated or on the web, it still showed something that if one party takes the time to do the test and get a high score, as opposed to someone who doesn't participate.It is hard enough to find a quality developer on a crowded platform and so each data point you add makes it better to differentiate candidates.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Removing-Skill-Tests-on-July-16th/td-p/609790

Removing Skill Tests on July 16th,8/22/19 0:50,,22602917a6385af2,ActiveMember,"*UPDATE: The removal of skill tests has been delayed until July 16th. Skill tests may still be visible when freelancers view other freelancers' profiles in search. We're aware of this bug and will have a fix in place by tomorrow (7/17).A few months ago we ran a test to evaluate the impact of removing skill tests, announced here. As a result of the data from the test, we will be removing skill tests from the platform on July 9th July 16.Our research found that clients don’t find skill tests important when making a hiring decision. They found profile introductions, portfolios, and job feedback to better showcase a freelancer’s skills and experience. -1Here in the forums, many of you have pointed out that skill test scores can easily be manipulated by cheating, as many skill test answers can be found online.-2 Additionally, we frequently hear that these skill tests – especially technical ones – quickly become outdated or irrelevant.-3 This decreases the value and accuracy of skill test results to fairly reflect a freelancer’s proficiency in that skill.Instead of continuing to provide development resources towards skill tests and asking freelancers to invest time on tests that don’t provide much additional value, we will be removing them all together.-4 This means starting July 9th freelancers will no longer be able to take skill tests, and prior skill test results will be removed from profiles. The elements to reach 100% profile completion will change and no longer include new skill test results. However, all freelancers will maintain their current profile completion percentage gained from skill tests up to the time of this announcement.Passing the Upwork Readiness test will continue to be required for new freelancers to be eligible for the Rising Talent program. The “Tests” link in the navigation bar will be renamed to “Upwork Readiness Test” and direct straight to the Upwork Readiness Test page where new freelancers will also find links to read our Freelancer Manual and watch videos in our Education Hub.To set yourself apart from the competition, we recommend following these best practices for your profile.-5 We also recommend creating specialized profiles to market your services if you haven’t already, which come with category-specific ways to demonstrate your talent and are intended to help you showcase your skills.1- What took you so long to realize this? I got my first job here in Upwork without the skills test reflected in my profile. The client didn't even notice that I don't have skills test and that was in 2017. What the client is looking for is your ability to fulfill the job by looking at certain specific skill for that kind of job.2 -This is so true by just googling your way around in the net.3 -This is also true. Just like programming languages evolving everyday so as the relevance of other technical skills.4 -What took you so long to realize this?5 -It's really hard to set myself from other competitors when Upwork locked my account.

Although I did see the potential for skills tests to be a way for freelancers to get started on the platform after they've first signed up and are waiting for someone to take a chance on them.Perhaps there is a way to revamp skills testing to provide some insight on the possible proficiency for new freelancers so they can get their first gig.,Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Removing-Skill-Tests-on-July-16th/td-p/609790

Removing Skill Tests on July 16th,8/15/19 20:36,,d685999cfb16ee1c,CommunityGuru,"I have to interject something. I don't feel either way about the tests though I respect that people have strong opinions about it. The ""Logo Design Test"" was a complete joke and could in no way be used to determine if someone can design a logo or not. And I say this as a logo design expert of over 20 years having designed hundreds of logos for all manner of businesses.Firstly the test was asking rudimentary technical questions about basic functions of Illustrator and CorelDraw. Aside from the fact that hardly anybody uses Corel, both AI and Corel are simply vector tools used to implement the designs which constitutes about 2 percent of logo design. It was as though the writer of the test knew absolutely NOTHING about what it takes to design a logo and took a really bad wild guess at that. It was like asking a carpenter questions to determine if he knows how a hammer works.And I've found that to be true of a lot of aspects of Upworks. The stock questions for each profession are ones that have nothing to do with that profession ""What challenging part of this job are you most skilled at?"" First of all, if you are a professional who does something for a living nothing about it should be particularly challenging.

Removing Skill Tests on July 16th,8/16/19 3:30,,e954458f01d5e7f9,CommunityGuru,"I have to interject something. I don't feel either way about the tests though I respect that people have strong opinions about it. The ""Logo Design Test"" was a complete joke and could in no way be used to determine if someone can design a logo or not. And I say this as a logo design expert of over 20 years having designed hundreds of logos for all manner of businesses.Firstly the test was asking rudimentary technical questions about basic functions of Illustrator and CorelDraw. Aside from the fact that hardly anybody uses Corel, both AI and Corel are simply vector tools used to implement the designs which constitutes about 2 percent of logo design. It was as though the writer of the test knew absolutely NOTHING about what it takes to design a logo and took a really bad wild guess at that. It was like asking a carpenter questions to determine if he knows how a hammer works.And I've found that to be true of a lot of aspects of Upworks. The stock questions for each profession are ones that have nothing to do with that profession ""What challenging part of this job are you most skilled at?"" First of all, if you are a professional who does something for a living nothing about it should be particularly challenging. It's what you do and to state it that way implies that your profession is challenging to you in which case you are in the wrong line of work. The client may find it challenging, that's why they hired a professional.

During a procedure to take a lung biopsy, they cut my lung and I had tremendous internal bleeding, and was immediately on life support and on 100% hi flow oxygen for 22 days, then spent over two years recovering. I had to learn to walk again and use my arms and hands after being in bed for 5 weeks. During that time, I lost my home, and had to sell 90% of my possessions, over years of hard work, just to get back on my feet. I was unable to work and meet clients and do my photography, because I was relapsing from the lung disease, so my friend Melissa had success on Upwork and told me about it. I was able to start working on Upwork in March and now I now have a 99% Success Rate and tons of new clients. Upwork basically saved me and restored my self-confidence and worth, and made it possible for me to fully recover and pay for medication and all that I need.

And I also ended up with an anerysm.I have been reading this thread while being irrationally supportive of the idea of sending an invoice to UpWork. It just seems so much simpler, you know?Yeah, I know... a freelancer doesn't provide his services to UpWork. He provides them to the buyer, instead.Also, if I understood right, UpWork sends the buyer an invoice on the seller's behalf... so if the buyer decides to file these invoices, the seller - who has been sending his invoices to supposedly the wrong entity (UpWork) - will be screwed.Did I get this part right?However, many people have been calling the invoices UpWork sendsridiculous, useless and illegal.Also - and I'm not a seller on UpWork yet, so this is assuming - who actually deposits the money on the freelancer's paypal or bank account? Who's the payer here? If UpWork is anything like any other freelancing website, it is UpWork who pays. The entity that pays is the entity that gets the invoice. That's the logic I use when I work with my own personal clients anyway.So little by little, at least in my head, the idea of seding invoices to UpWork directly seems to gain some validity.Now's is when the experts come in and explain me why I'm wrong...",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-asked-questions-about-VAT-for-EU-freelancers/td-p/131032

Frequently asked questions about VAT for EU freelancers,4/23/20 2:58,,c0c3ba4ecbcd3286,ActiveMember,"Hello, I'm also new to the platform and I have a UK based limted company that I have set up as an agency on Upwork and added my VAT number to.This forum makes it very clear that once approved I will not pay VAT on any fees that Upwork charge to me - I understand this.What is not clear however is what happens when my company does work for a UK based client through Upwork?If I'm correct in my understanding then either:1. The UK based client contracts Upwork USA for software services. Upwork then contracts my company to carry out the services which I then provide as a supplier to Upwork. In this scenario my company is exporting services to the USA which means that it is accounted for as VAT exempt.or2. Client contracts my company for sofware services and Upwork US is acting as a collections agency for payment. In the scenario my UK company is providing services to another UK company or individual so it's my duty to add 20% VAT to the invoice total (the UK based client can then claim back that VAT from the government if they are VAT registered).I'm clear on the tax law so it not a matter for my tax consultant and more a matter of how Upwork legally structures it's fees.

Sequential invoices are required by EU law(European VAT Directive, Article 226, Paragraph (2) )- you do not provide the full name and address for customers outside the EU because you make this optional. Full name and address are required by EU law(European VAT Directive, Article 226, Paragraph (5) )- you do not allow for the freelancer to directly charge VAT (such as when the customer is in the same country as the freelancer or when the customer does not have a valid european VAT-ID)Here is the reference to the EuropeanVAT Directivehttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32006L0112&from=enHere is the excerpt detailing all the information an Invoice should contain in the EU:Also this that I mentioned above:""If you charge your client VAT through Upwork then Upwork takes 20% of that VAT, and then charges you VAT on that 20% out of the VAT you charge your client.""In light of all this, I don't see how anyone can use Upwork's invoice, considering it does not follow EU law, and furthermore you penalize us for following it ourselves by taking cuts out of the taxes we are due",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-asked-questions-about-VAT-for-EU-freelancers/td-p/131032

That law has now changed, and as such Upwork is required to start adding the VAT.If you're asking about the import VAT that Joachim keeps mentioning, then the procedure should have been that freelancers within the EU register the service fees in their bookkeeping as purchases from outside the EU. They should then have sent that information (probably once a month) to the customs or tax agency that deals with import tax in their country. The information sent includes the amount paid for services bought, and the VAT due on those services. The VAT is then paid to the relevant authority.In many cases the paid VAT can either be reimbursed or used to reduce the VAT owed from the VAT charged on their services and remitted to the tax offices.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-asked-questions-about-VAT-for-EU-freelancers/td-p/131032

VAT and other taxes the freelancer is due are the responsibility of the respective governments. With VAT there is the additional fact that VAT is not costs for all those freelancers that are not VAT exempted (me being one of them). VAT is costs only for VAT exempted freelancers as they cannot claim it back. Upwork is also not showing costs for money transfer, gains or losses related to fluctuating exchange rates etc. Each freelancer will be able to do the math regarding the taxes all by himself. Especially in view of the fact that the freelancer should always have paid the VAT in the past too, directly with his tax office.Yes, you're right.I didn't mean to imply that Upwork has some kind of responsibility.It's just that they *could* do it, since they have all the information they need to show the amount after deductions, and in my view it would be very useful if they did.In any case it's not as urgent as other features, for instanceaccess to the client's invoices.BTW, is there any news on that front?

Your questions are valid! I have the same questions, spent 4 hours talking to TECH SUPPORT, which has very poor English, and are completely unprepared to answer our questions! They always escalate stuff and say 'ask a local tax advisor'.Guess this is the way UpWork treats freelancers now, because we're little, have no say in this, and it's totally fair to charge what they believe is right. Give them time, pretty soon it will be 15% or 20%. Better yet, why don't they take all of it. Should be called 'volunteerWork'. Somebody from tech support actually told me freelancers from the EU requested this. I don't see anybody in this forum saying 'good call UpWork'.

The invoice will always be an EU consumer (me) and an US provider (UpWork), and, in that case, since UpWork is not an EU based company, the invoices should be VAT exempted, right?2 - Since I'm a particular (not an enterprise) and I don't normally do business with foreign countries (except here on UpWork), my VAT number (which, where I live, is the same as a the fiscal id #) won't be recognized as valid on the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System).In this case, you'll still charge the VAT amount and then? What will you do with that money?It says it will be remitted to the respective EU government. But, without a valid VAT number associated to it, to whom this amount will be assigned? Or you'll just send piles of money in bulk for each country without specifing to whom that money is related?3 - Other than the 3 services that you say you are taxing the VAT, you also have another payed service: the withdrawal of money, which costs 1€ per transaction. Will that 1€ also be VAT taxable?I hope that, this time, my post will appear, and that I will be able to get some answers.Thanks in advance for the time spent reading this and for the answers provided (assuming there will be some).",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-asked-questions-about-VAT-for-EU-freelancers/td-p/131032

Everything is much clearer now while initial announcement from Upwork sadly lacked many important points that you've covered now.I still have some questions and would be really happy if Upwork representatives can clarify them.1) Does it all have to do with new EU VAT legislations about ""automated digital services"" applied from 1st of Jan 2015? There are many digital services that I am buying from US companies while living in EU. They do not comply tothose rules yet: I am thinking about other freelancing platforms (Elance, Freelancer, Guru), I am also thinking about various payment collectors: PayPal, Skrill, etc.Where can I see the clear EU law that says that service providers like Upwork belong to ""automated digital services"" and have to comply with the abovementioned rule?2) Digital Nomad solution that you've mentioned:In cases like mineI might be""on the move"" and stay in each country for 1-2 weeks only. It is obviously too much hassle to register myself in a new country on Upwork each time I change my location. I guess it also will not ""look well"" for my prospective clients if I ""change flags"" that often.Should I then just keep my profile registered in any chosen countrywhere I have documents that can prove my connection to this country? Or should people like me simply open an Upwork agency registered in any country where we have a company open?Thank you in advance for claryfying that!Regards,Cat",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Frequently-asked-questions-about-VAT-for-EU-freelancers/td-p/131032

Terms of Service Update 2018,4/20/18 15:04,,600a8bae0e2256d7,CommunityGuru,"Lena,One of the most important aspects of conducting business with a client starts with communication. Up until this moment, I have always relied on Skype communication prior to having an active contract in place and at later post-hiring stages too. We were not allowed to post ourcontact information via a proposal, but it was totally fine to share those in case the client wants to discuss the project in detail via video call on Skype for example, so both of us get to feel the personal connection, and discuss more details and share files quickly to estimate things and give quotes, make decisions, etc...Messaging on Upwork has got some serious issues. I often don't get notified of new messages, and you never know when the platform goes down. You also introduced video call feature, and I tried it enormously on Upwork and can ensure to you that this is nowhere close to the experience one can have on Skype. I have a 4G connection and your app does not offer video compression and sucks all my bandwidth when I call via your app, because your app thinks that I have a speedy connection so they can deliver ultra-high video quality through my HD webcam, and if I want to share screen it doesn't always work because my connection isalmost taken by the video, so I have a very hard time sharing my screen with my clients on Upwork Video Calls while my camera is on. Skype does make video compression and adjust depending on your activity. Sharing screen on Upwork requires an additional extension installed in my browser which slows it down. Your entire app runs in the browser actually and this is something I don't like because it doesn't take advantage of the native system resources like a native Windows or Mac app, and makes my browser experience bad all-together. There is also no way to speak on video from Upwork's mobile app like we can do on Skype. I understand that you are improving this app and I have spotted several improvements in the past few months, but you must understand that your app currently cannot be a Skype replacement by any mean.On top of all that, I have been in situations where Upwork goes down for hours and I lose connection with the client and sometimes lose opportunities. Skypehelped me stay in touch with them and explain to them about your continuoustechnical problems so if they're a new client they don't have to think thatUpwork doesn't work and they don't have to run away. I think it's a blessing to have another medium of connection because Upwork'splatform is not stable. If you really wanna apply these terms, at least make sure the platform is consistent and that your communication apps are working as the end user is expecting them to work.I highly recommend that you guys revise this term. You guys are afraid that the client and the freelancer decide to work off-platform to avoid paying the fees - which is unethical - but I understand why you're doing it, but I don't think you should apply a punishment to good people only because bad people exist. It's your job to spot people who are misusing the platform and not punish the loyal ones who never thought about cheating or misusing the platform in any way.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Terms-of-Service-Update-2018/td-p/482567

New Rate Tip Feature,7/14/16 13:27,,c025ccec2ac83b1c,CommunityGuru,"I think abetter way to regulate prices on Upwork, for the benefit of freelancers and Upwork itself would be to determine the rates for the different categories of freelancers, and to set it in such a manner that if a cleint wanted an expert, then he could not hire below a given rate. On the other hand, if he or she wanted an entry level freelancer then he could not hire above a certain rate.On the same note, if a freelancer set his or her profile as an expert, the his rate cannot go lower than the set value, and if the freelancer set it as entry level, then the rate would not go higher than the given value. The same would apply for Intermediate category.This sort of rule I think would regulate the market accordingly and prevent clients from posting expert jobs and hiring freelancers at $3/hr. Placing an upper limit on what freelancers can charge does not benefit Upwork or freelancers. Controlling our rates to that extent is not consistent with freelancing, and there's no way to accurately ""determine the rates for the different categories of freelancers"" in the context of a global market and all of our individual abilities and the various kinds/levels of services we offer.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/New-Rate-Tip-Feature/td-p/141967

Updates to Showing Active Earners in Search Results,3/5/20 17:27,,c862c0aed76ee995,CommunityGuru,"As we originally announced here, profiles of freelancers who don’t earn on Upwork for a period of time are set to private. Freelancers can keep their profile public regardless of their earnings by subscribing to Freelancer Plus Membership and also have access to free options to turn their profile status back to public.A few things have changed since this program was introduced almost two years ago, more importantly we have expanded our ID verification programs. We have also collected a lot of valuable feedback here in the Community and from other channels. As a result, we’ve made some adjustments to the program by increasing the period of time freelancers can go without earning before their profiles are set to private.Profiles of freelancers with a history of earnings on the platform will remain public unless they have not earned in more than 2 years. This will benefit freelancers who are active but may work on contracts with milestones that take several months or longer to complete. Profiles of new freelancers who haven’t earned on Upwork will be set to private after 90 days.Freelancers will still be able to subscribe to a Freelancer Plus Membership if they don’t want their profile to be set to private if they don’t earn. Freelancers will also be able to request Upwork Customer Support to reset their profile visibility for free, as they have in the past.Wouldn't 3 months be enough, since escrow can only hold funds for that period? So you can't actually work on a milestone for longer than that, or has that changed as well? If it hasn't it means you are not actively earning unless you submit work for a milestone at least every 3rd month. 2 years is overdoing it in my opinion. Why not rather let the freelancers who are using Upwork be the only ones being visible on Upwork? Or at least put the ones that aren't earning in the bottom of the search results if you must have them there at all.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Updates-to-Showing-Active-Earners-in-Search-Results/td-p/710815

I definitely want to remove one feedback, which almost ruined my week when it was posted from a client who was insincere from the very start.2.Transparency is of course compromised. In fact, if you would like to make it 100% transparent, let the contract be transparent, the only way is to let the freelancer and client have a go at each other. Debate, rebut and so on.And I definitely would love it. To keep the sense and sensibility on track, a client's profile is 99% fishy (looks so, thanks to the opaque and null descriptions).3. Your displacing statement makesit sound fishy. It could be better if you would provide options on why the feedback was removed. And I mean sensible options like- Client's feedback did not match thebehaviorr, Unruly Behaviour, Wrongful Claims (if lying is too harsh a word, although I was swindled by a lying client and I have no hassle in shouting that personality trait of the client).I have already sent a request to remove the said feedback (My bad, I was diplomatic and rated the client 4.85, while the con girl rate me 2.85.

Having one or two adverse feedback contributions isn't going to keep you off my recommendations list to my client.Therefore, seeing 'feedback removed by freelancer' in this situation would be perfectly acceptable to us.I really do think it's important for clients to use critical thinking skills.

MICR printing is expensive, and only profitable if done on a large scale—such as if one had access to a (decryptable) theft from a database.If people choose to keep their financial details private, that is their business.

For starters, this is a tough break for Canadian freelancers like Amanda. although given that it's being 'tested' on 'new' cllients only, the initial impact might not be as pronounced as when it becomes available to all US clients. SinceI reside in the US, from a selfish perspective it should benefit me, except that in my case most of my clients are from the US anyway. Living in Hawaii as I do, the Americas are the closest population centers where time difference isn't vast, although I have a few long-term clients in other continents. I understand Upwork's reasoning: if a client states a geographic preference, then it ought to be respected, but I for instance have applied to jobs specifying North America, even though Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific! so there's something to be said for flexibility.I'm also a bit surprised that no one with a US agency has commented, because they're also excluded from US only jobs, which is a curious inconsistency. And someone made a good point, that in excluding freelancers from the rest of the world, a US client might receive fewcompetitive proposals and prematurely conclude that Upwork freelancers aren't up to the task. So perhaps this feature could be enhanced so that the client can choose to 'open up' the bidding to non-US freelancers after a certain period of time and have the job relisted as though it were a new job, thus making location more of a preference than a requirement: not saying this would work, but it's my attempt at improving the location selection feature.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Testing-freelancer-location-for-job-posts/td-p/334213

Guru Jess C pointed out the thread is 2 years old, so maybe we can continue here.Your response (below) was helpful. My follow-up question was about how the talent group gets the info. I would not want to send the client info saying that it was a bad referral. Impressions are important, and that would be a negative and unnecessary first impression to make with that potential client. I wouldn't want to say something negative about the Talent Group in front of your client either. Some of the other commenters on the older thread pointed out that the Talent Group seems secretive. Is there a way now or potentially upcoming to send feedback to talent group managers to about referrals, without bothering a client?When you decline an invitation that doesn't fit your profile skills or expectations, then you have the option to provide a reason as to why you have chosen to decline. Please note that the Talent Group team checks the information left in your reason for declining and uses it to to continue to improve their processes so it is a great place to provide feedback for the team that will help them improve the invitations.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Update-on-Talent-Specialists-Program/td-p/464994

I didn't offer the post as a ringing endorsement of the system. I offered it as an example of the only guy I've heardof who got a job through the Talent Specialists. Maybe the satire part of it didn't quite land. That's one example of a hit. To be precise, it's the only one I've ever heard of. It's from last September.And just to be clear, I haven't heard of another one like it. I've read loads of posts on this forum complaining about them. Those are the misses. And you know what? I think people at UW who implement the Talent Specialist program really should read those posts too. Especially this most recent one:https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Talent-Specialists-AGAIN/m-p/464432#M283758Secondly, the problem I mentioned isn't that UW doesn't offer the agents any form of training. My comments about the training are specifically directed towards the ideathatagents are not selected as a result of having extensiveHR experience, which is suggeted by the name (""Talent Specialist"") and which is somethingclients who use the service may expect as a result of the name (i.e., the specific problem I see is that the name might suggest that they are talent scouts, which they're not). The agents clearly lack any previous human resources training, for instance, having attended a specialized human resources program at a college or university or we wouldn't see the types of results that we are seeing. If you call someone a ""Talent Specialist,"" you're creating an expectation about that role being closely aligned to that ofa ""talent scout."" That's clearly not what's on offer here and if you're creating that expectation, people will be put off when you don't deliver.If you're going to offer this service, I believe that you should give the workers who provide it a name that's more in line with the reality of the service that's being provided.Please read Tiffany's post below. I believe she raises an excellent point. I appreciate her insights because I know she's been a tireless advocatefor raising the bar on the professionalism of this platform. Please also read Petra's post in the link I provided above. That's a clear statement about why the Talent Specialist service is currently inadequateand potentially dangerous on a professional level.Finally, basing your assessment of the success of the system on survey results is quite limited and probably leads to an overly optimistic view that the system isworking much better than it actually is. Busy professionalswho have just wasted their time on a useless search probably won't also waste their time completing the survey. They'll justmove on without looking further.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Update-on-Talent-Specialists-Program/td-p/464994

The option to eliminate skrill must bea B2B conflict. If it were as you say, that skrill has been screwing freelancers, then the solution is not to get rid of it, but rather to have it as an option for those that wish to continue using it. You can label it as SCREW-Y as you do with other money transfer services. For example a wire transfer costs $30 per transaction, that I know. You could do the same with skrill. Tell freelancers what to expect when they use Skrill, but then leave it as an option.If your motives are sincere, you should know that Payoneer is not a good option at all, at least for freelancers from my country (Uganda). These guyspay you to screw us out of our hard earned dollars. It will cost me $40 at least on every transaction, including monthly maintenance costs, ATM use, card payment, mastercard transaction fee, payoneer fee, and my bank's processing fee. Their business template is really long term. I see it being cheaper when more people sign up, but for now it isn't. It just SCREWS the little guy.

As someone already mentioned - if it is an issue that Skrill is asking for a higher transaction fee or something in that manner - then you can just make fee a bit higher - but removing it completely is a disaster.I really hope that there is a chance that this won’t happen in the end as it may just leave us in the dead-end.Thanks, hope that you will read all the complains and if you would actually ask people around if they are fine with removing Skrill I think you would be shocked with amount that would disagree.Best Wishes",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Updates-to-Payment-Methods-for-non-US-based-freelancers/td-p/302605

This Mpesa thing you have introduced for us Kenyanscould be the best/worst thing ever to have happened. Today I decided to try it and here are my experiences.1. The Mpesa customer Care agents have no idea whatsoever what Upwork is, What payments from Upwork to Mpesa is. Mpesa being a mobile phone transfer method does does not have a web page like Skrill where I can check if my funds have been recieved. I have to rely on either receiptof this money or getting a customer care agent who knows the workings of these things to sort me out.2. Speed. Skrill normally took about 10 minutes from withdrawingmy cash at Upwork to reciept of said funds in my phone (Mpesa incidentally was how the disbursed their funds.) It' been 7 hours now and no funds received. I've heard tales where freelancers have to wait 24 hours before receipt of money. Actually an agent from Upwork has told me to wait for the said 24 hours. Anyone that works for his money knows the frustrationsof having pay delayed, so to me this has not sat well. Suppose I had an emergency?In conclusion I say this, Mpesa to Upwork will be a good thing, but only if they streamline the process. Surely if it takes me 10 minutes to transferUpwork to Skrill to Mpesa then Upwork to Mpesa should take lesser time?Maybe some people have had bad experiences with Skrill, I haven't so I'll stick with it for as long as it lasts.

This switch is very uncomfortable at the moment.***Rumor*** has it that the Payment Option - M-Pesa, that Upwork linked for us will pay us a flat rate of KES 95 to the Dollar.Considering that we are receiving ~KES 99 to the dollar at the moment, that is quite a drop. A 4 percent drop to be precise.So, for every $1000, we will be getting $950 worth of Kenyan Shillings instead of $990. This math gives us ~$480 less annually.Let me put it to perspective, since it could be pocket change elsewhere.Here, that is equivalent to a salary of a primary school teacher for 1 month. Or a policeman. It can support a high school student for a year, and that includes tuition fees. Some surgeries can be performed for less.Why am I saying this?Skrill was very very good. The fact that it dropped cards and will start charging exorbitant fees from April is really unfortunate. I'm not asking that you bring it back.Paypal was the next cheapest option. However, bringing in the $2 per transaction means that I will be dropping $8 extra a month. Or, I will need to put in an EXTRA day every year to pay for PayPal fees. So let's drop it.Direct transfer to local banks? That's the only viable option now. It will still be expensive.Suggested:***Let your people talk to M-Pesa people to revise their FX Rates. It is exploitative to the freelancer, and I really really hope Upwork is rooting for its freelancers. I understand many freelancers who suggested that you bring M-Pesa to the Table were not aware that the Exchange rates would be dismal. Hopefully this rumor will remain a rumor.*** Please consider bringing in some more options. Cheaper options, not just based on how big the bank/service provider is.

Whatever your opinion of Skrill is, it was and still is the best way for me personally to receive funds, since paypal is **bleep** in Ukraine, US bank for a Ukrainian is definitely helpful (sarcasm in case you didn't figure it), wire transfer with 30$ fee per withdrawal is so much better than Skrill price wise, oh yeah (another sarcasm), and Payoneer is also more expensive than Skrill. I don't know what you did during your ""thorough review"" but you've reached a very dumb decision. This, along with your ridiculous fees makes me even more turned off about using your platform.

I wish you great success as well.As for Upwork: I still feel that Upwork has simply created a flawed program. I doubt they thought it through carefully as I can't believe that they intended to create a framework that blocks new people from getting equal consideration for jobs. While employers may be allowed to consider all applicants, I'm sure that many simply reject anyone who doesn't meet all the ""basic"" requirements they set like ""Rising Talent"", hour worked, etc. It creates an artificial barrier for newcomers, which is pretty dumb if a website intends to keep growing.Perhaps those who came up with this should re-examine their program. And, how about linking the program name on the job postings to explanatory information so it's not necessary to hunt all over the site to decifer what the heck it is.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Rising-Talent-Program-NOW-LIVE/td-p/97187

The system doesn't consider activity on the account vs. date of creation, just date of creation.I created my account on oDesk, years ago, for an offline client that wanted to use oDesk's system to pay me. I had forgotten about ituntil last November, when I logged in out of curiosity, and out of curiosity bid on a job. I won it, which led to another job; I soon met every other qualification for ""Rising Talent"" -- but never got an invitation.So my conclusion is that either a) not everyone who is qualified gets an invitation (not necessarily a bad thing) or b) the creation date of my account was the disqualifier. I'm inclined to think it was b).My advice? Just focus on continuing to provide a quality service, and everything else will take care of itself -- in the form of profile badges (you're on your way to Top-Rated), and, more importantly, excellent clients.Good luck to you!

I followed tips and advises from Upwork as much as I could, and completed my profile 100% on day 1. I applied carefully, sending unique proposals to each application that I was confident I can deliver on. I check Upwork multiple times per day. I am just so enthusiastic about trying this out hoping it will work out that I really put a lot of effort into this! So in this less than 1 month, I got my first client who was so happy with my work that they hired me again. I can't even begin to describe how happy I was to see the 5 stars on my profile!However, I think I joined Upwork while you are in the middle of some very big changes. (Which I felt in many different ways: like the panicky nights I needed to submit drafts but couldn't log in, getting the Crikey! Oops! Zut Alors! errors, among others.) So today I found out that I have lost the 5-STAR rating that is normally seen on my profile. And since I'm very new, I have no Job Success Score.. and now no 5-star rating as well.. So sad. I'm really worried I will no longer get any jobs because of this. If I don't get more jobs, then I won't ever get a Job Success Score.So in my worry about that, I researched some more, stumbling onto this thread about Rising Talent.. I think the Rising Talent program could really help me and the other seriously hardworking newbie freelancers out there who really want this to work out!For the meantime I think I will upload more work to my portfolio, hopefully that will somehow help, too. I'd appreciate any advise and tips from the long-timers, too!Hoping to be considered for this program..",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Rising-Talent-Program-NOW-LIVE/td-p/97187

Use all your monthly connects, but apply a strategy when sending proposals. Don't just shoot them at anything you see available. If you see too many applicants, find a job with fewer applicants. You may have a higher chance there. Also, before applying, see who applied to the job and see if you have a serious competition. If so, in such cases I don't apply. I would be wasting my connects.

Know a deserving non-profit that focuses on skill development, sustainable income, or entrepreneurship? Have them send in a grant application to the Upwork Foundation by October 31st.Here is more information taken from our recent press release:Upwork announced acall for grant applications throughThe Upwork Foundation Initiative, a program designed to open up new prospects for those at risk of being left behind by theFourth Industrial Revolution. Grants will financially support the Initiative’s goals by funding nonprofits around the world that help to build a future of inclusive learning and economic opportunity. With the inaugural call for applications, Upwork aims to award three to five grants of up to $50,000 each.“Upwork’s mission is to create economic opportunities so people have better lives. Our business model supports this mission by creating jobs for skilled knowledge workers, and these grants are meant to complement that impact by supporting underserved communities who are at risk of being left behind by the changing nature of work,” said Elizabeth Tse, Senior Vice President of Operations and Executive Sponsor of The Upwork Foundation initiative.Grant-funded organizations or projects will focus on one of three key areas:Skill Development: By 2030, more than 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories. Grant recipients will help build marketable skills in underserved populations.Livelihoods: More than 780 million people live below the international poverty line. Grant recipients will help create sustainable and consistent income in underserved communities. Entrepreneurship: Over the next 15 years, approximately 600 million jobs are needed to absorb the youth entering the labor market. Grant recipients will promote business and job creation in underserved communities.Grants fall into one of the following categories:General Support Grants are unrestricted grants made to high-impact organizations to cover the cost of operations or unspecified programming. By investing in the operation of cutting-edge non-profits, we are able to support the high-impact work that they accomplish and fill a needed funding window. Project-Specific Grants are grants specifically designated for a project. These grants are used by organizations to fund one or several key workstreams. By investing in specific projects, we are able to tangibly point to impactful work and tie it to our funding.Read more here",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Last-call-for-Upwork-Foundation-grant-applications/td-p/659089
Recap on Improvements to Design and Creatives Search Experience,10/11/19 8:18,10/11/19 8:22,d6140618d296f29b,CommunityManager,"This year, we have released several new features and updates for the design and creative community to help freelancers and agencies showcase their talents, and updated the search experience so clients can easily find the perfect match for their job. Since we know it can be easy to miss a new feature announcement, we wanted to make sure our design and creative community were aware of all of these new options to search, showcase and promote skills.Here are some of the features we’ve introduced this year to help freelancers and agencies become more successful:Portfolio templates. Showcase your work in different ways, with simple, flexible layouts. Portfolios in search results. Pick a portfolio image or video to highlight your creativity when you show up in clients’ search results.Specialized profiles. Specialized questions have been introduced to profiles and job posts that will help lead to more relevant and precise matches when more advanced search filters fully roll out. Agency profiles. Promote your agency’s portfolio of work, featured clients, and the services you offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Advanced search filters for clients (coming soon). Clients will soon be able to search for you based on the specialization, deliverable type, and skills in your specialized profile.Over the past year, we’ve been building and testing features to help clients easily evaluate design and creative talent and find the perfect match. Here are some of the improvements clients will notice:Portfolio visuals in search results. Get a better sense of a freelancer’s style and quality of work when you search, without needing to click into their profiles.Advanced search filters (coming soon). Filter talent by the skills they have, the type of work they specialize in, and the kinds of deliverables they can create.Portfolio templates. More easily evaluate freelancer portfolios with big, beautiful visuals and layouts tailored to the project.Relevant experience, upfront. Make quicker hiring decisions by seeing the most relevant reasons a freelancer would be a good match – directly in search results. We're just getting started and we would love to hear your feedback on how we can further improve your experience.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Recap-on-Improvements-to-Design-and-Creatives-Search-Experience/td-p/656834

Clients aren't going to find the right person the first or even tenth invitation. This is really the kiss of death for Upwork.

Plus some of our jobs last multiple months, so I can't justify spending a monthly membership fee when I may not post a job for a few months.The saddest part about this whole move is the freelancers who are going to be affected by clients not posting their jobs anymore here and it results in their income being cut drasticly. For some of them around the world in some of these countries, it could be devastating news.I will just say this before I end. Upwork has never been right from the beginning. Elance and oDesk were wonderful services that served two different type of crowds and did it amazingly well. Those two were forced together to make this mess call Upwork and it's just gone completely downhill since it was born and it's unfortunate. Knowing many other clients who use this platform and tons of freelancers as well, I know that I am not alone in that feeling and it's unfortunate.I think if clients only hire once in a while and still want to invite several freelancers the best option would be to stay on basic and then pay for the featured job listing. No monthly fee and cheaper than the $50/month.Yes, $30 is less than $50, that's a lot to pay for more than 3 invites. And for a lot of us who are top rated with decent earnings, the only way we take on new work is via invites, because we're too busy working to search for new work.As someone mentioned, a lot of invites get declined, because they're just not correctly targeted, the budget is too low even though they say they want an expert, or we're just too busy at that moment to take on new work. So if you give a client 3 free invites, but they get two declines every time, that's really not very helpful to the clients.

I chatted with Upwork support to know what's going on with the names after realizing I was no longer able to show my full name on my profile. So the Upwork board members made such an unbelievable decision mainly for 2 reasons: a) Provide anonymity toservice providers b) Prevent off-platform workRight now service providers are not able to see the client's information at all until they actually get interviewed. And most of service providers do not want to hide their names unless necessary. If they ever want to hide their last name they should be able to do so by modifying a certain option like they used to do. They want as much exposure as possible. If they ever have some info to hide, that would be their earnings. Upwork doesn't require clients to undergo any verification while freelancers need to undergo strict verification process. This is one of the reasons that Upwork has so many fake job postings.I am certainthis change will NEVERprevent off platform work. This will make the Upwork platform look worse and dishonest than ever. I would like to point out that the biggest reason that peopleprefer working off platform is because of the high fee (20%) of Upwork. The only way to prevent off platform work will be decreasing the fee by a significant amount. Anonymity doesn't help off platform work.Varia K did mention that we can control visibility of our profiles in Google Search. Currently there is no option like this.

When was the last time you found a service provider through a Google search and then either praised or blamed Google based on your experience with that provider? The answer is never. Feelancer searching here is within a closed ecosystem. You aren't going to get results from Freelancer.com or any other service. Therefore how someone is displayed and what wording is used will absolutelyreflect on Upwork. Does Upwork want to ""feature"" or be ""sponsored"" by a freelancer with a poor JSS? Google wouldn't care about such things, but I'd imagine that UW must. To the extent that someone is ""featured"" it should be based upon their results and the value they are bringing to the platform. ""Sponsoring"" should also have gates as again I think it would reflect badly on UW to highlight a poor performing freelancer who winds up costing the platform more than profiting it. In this way I think in anyway highlightingsomeone just because they pay for a membership, is a bad idea. What would it say to a client that UWhighlights a freelancer with a crappy score and crappy review comments? Frankly this should not be a democracy but rather a meritocracy. UW needs to assign a value to each of its freelancers and then push those that bring the most and take the least. If you want that special treatment then you'd better earn it. Both sides maximize their profits that way.

See the update on the new client My Jobs Dashboard we released earlier this month. This week, we’re rolling out a feature for businesses to make it easier for clients to find their coworkers and collaborate with their team on a company account when registering for Upwork. There are many advantages to sharing a company account with your coworkers which make hiring, managing and communicating with freelancers much easier. Company accounts allow for transparency between coworkers allowing you to collaborate on hiring as well as share details on spending with combined reporting. You can find more information about company accounts in our Hiring Headquarters’ article: Guide to Creating a Company Account.In the past, clients could only invite coworkers to their company accounts, which would then prompt their coworkers to create an Upwork account. This new feature will make this process more seamless by automatically recognizing new clients’ email addresses at registration, and suggest that they join an existing account created by their coworkers. OLD EXPERIENCE:NEW EXPERIENCE:Existing clients who are admins on their accounts will have the option to enable the new auto-join setting which will allow for any coworkers with a matching business email address to join their company account automatically at registration. Auto-join settings are available to all account owners with a verified business email address. Permissions can also be set for coworkers on the company account.

I had upwork contracts started from a conversation on linkedin and asked them to create a job offer on upwork just for the sake of future clients being able to see my work history.Just a note: all of those changes do not affect me, they affect members of my agency.I see that the moderators got instructions from their employers/supervisors/whatever to say that it's all about clients being able to find ""active"" candidates.

Firstly, let's introduce JSS and Top Rated programs that are not going to actually show if the freelancers work well but forcing them to be active, make at least $1000 a year, decline annoying invitation withing 24 hours and so on. Nice, but that's not enough, let's introduce hiding of the freelancer accounts for the sake of ""providing better search results to clients"" but frankly speaking we want to whip upfreelancers to give us money every month (not via the ""plus"" membership but via sending more proposals and accepting offers that would seem unattractive to them another time).That sounds pretty good from the perspective of upwork, freelancers can think whatever they want, they can crush the community forums, insult moderators but they don't have a lot of alternatives.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Showing-Active-Earners-in-Search-Results/td-p/351243

A new freelancer will apply for jobs from new clients.And the bad jobs will have badfreelancers, so they will consume each other, have bad experices and never return back here.If the freelancer has a good jss score, he will get more work, stand out better, gain more money, etc. , the star rating was so bad for providing this, basically all decent freelancers had a 4.5 - 5 star rating.---Keep changing things Upwork, and don't worry about posters who present their opinions as factsandkeep feeding one another with negativity and discontent.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

Now, for UpWork, all this were put behind a Job Success flag that does not reflect how well you performed your job, but instead, makes a sum of your activity in the site and choose a number that - to them - show how good you are (in terms of making money for them, I believe)Yeah, for UpWork it doesnt matter if you re a good professional.It just matters ""how much money you gave us the past year"" - so, any feedback over 12 months is erased from the job success calculation, since you ´re probably not being profittable enough for them.I had a 4.98 star review, excellent client reviews, not a single failed project. But since many clients do not bother in giveing feedback, my success rate dropped from 100% to 78% and might drop more, even if I dont perform any job.Now, either we become feedback **edited for Community Guidelines**, perhaps adding to our cover letters that ""I will work for feedback instead of money"" or we will see it drop and drop and drop, no matter how good we do our jobs, because there AREbe clients that does not bother to END contracts at all, much less give feedback.It has been good at oDesk, horrible at UpWork and it is time to think about options.

I am hiring for 2 yrs and not ONE i hired did the work correctly...""Christy, I read both of your posts, which I quoted only a snippet from here.I think you are a sincere, honest client.But what you have been trying for the past 2 years has not worked. You should try something different.I am representative of many Upwork contractors, so what I am about to say is not about me. (By the way, I'm not available for hire right now, and I don't solicit work in the Community Forum.)You have been hiring people who simply aren't capable of the assignments you have been giving them. They are not even sufficiently decent programmers to know that they're not capable of the work you have assigned to them.Had you hired me, you would have initially been shocked by my hourly rate. But you would have had your website up and running, without compromise in quality or functionality, one and a half years ago, and you would have spent less than you did trying to hire sub-rate programmers.If you are going to hire low-cost programmers, you need to hire MANY of them and give them duplicate assignments so you can quickly weed out the ones who aren't as good and stick with the ones who provide you the value you're looking for.You hired a bunch of inexperienced copy-and-pasters who (according to your own post) just copied-and-pasted junk from the Internet and didn't understand any of it.Had I worked on your project, I would have used code that I created myself, including my own frameworks and libraries. There would be nothing under the hood that I don't understand.Now, having said that, I'm kind of on the opposite extreme in my techniques from the people you hired. Most programmers use libraries and frameworks created by ohers effectively. So you don't necessarily need to hire somebody like me. The people who hire me want things that simply don't exist anywhere else, because they're trying to gain advantages over their competitors. But there is a happy medium between someone like myself and inexperienced copy-and-pasters, to be found among high-quality programmers. That is who you should have hired.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

However, I was inactive for some time (old clients didn't provide new tasks, I didn't search for new clients actively). And my JSS dropped to 75% or something like that. Literally NOTHING happenned, yet I suddenly became a terrible programmer. I've recently completed a couple of tiny jobs, now my JSS is back at 100% again. And I'm ""TOP RATED"", again. Really? REALLY? Is a number jumping from 100% to 75% and back while doing almost nothing is what clients should rely on?This system is complete and utter nonsense.What worries me most is that owners of Upwork think that JSS is more ""meaningful"" and ""reliable"", because star score is too ""inflated"", that everyone has a score of 4.8+. Well, the reason JSS isn't (or is it?) inflated yet is that no one cared about it before. Now that it's the most important thing on the proile, contractors will start asking clients for a perfect ""private"" rating, clients will start giving 10/10 ""recommendation"" just to please contractors...And where do we end up? Back at point zero. What did we achieve? Nothing. Yet another ""rating"" which doesn't mean anything.Just stop trying to be clever. Stop it. Remove these nonsensical scores. The only actually reliable thing is comments clients and contractors leave each other, sometimes score. (Well, maybe not always, I've had a client who loves giving unreasonably praising feedback... And another who gave me 1 star after praising my work... But clients can do anything they want, right?)Oh, how good the world could have been if every client and every contractor were reasonable and didn't hesitate to provide meaningful star scores and comments!Don't forget that the only reason we have to worry about nonsensical and unfair JSS is that lots of SILLY people can't comprehend that 5 is ""exceptional"", 4 is ""excellent"" and 3 is ""good"" (I don't remember exact wording). This is why star rating is a failure. This is why Upwork owners try inventing new scoring systems.And the reason why ""Job Success Score"" will fail.Again. It isn't really much different from star rating. No obscuring of internal details can save it. It'll just delay its failure a bit. In several months, everyone will have 100% rating.Don't worry. You can't do anything. You will adapt.In a year or two, Upwork owners will invent another system. I'll be waiting. I bet on ""Like/Dislike"" system like on YouTube.

Job success scores only confuse things and do nothing to improve it. Very, very disappointed you guys made such an important decision obviously without thinking it through. It's not innovative it's definitely not better than a 5 star rating system.If this persist, I will have to leave Upwork and take my business to another freelancer site that recognizes a UNIVERSAL feedback system such as 5 stars as opposed to some mysterious ""Job Success"" score that no really knows how it works besides Upwork.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

Let me first make it clear that I'm not the sort of user that just doesn't like change of any sort, but this one is simply nonsensical.Judging by what I've read on the help page, the following things have taken a toll on my ""Job success rate"":- A client who'd started a contract with me realised that he didn't need the work done after all and cancelled the contract. Nothing to do with my skills at all, nothing to do with their satisfaction, but I still got -% because of it.- A client gave me five stars but never took the time to write a review. That, according to upwork, is a negative thing for me, because that also subtracted points from my JSR.That's everything I can think of, and I'm down to 77% although I've only got five-star ratings. For satisfied clients who either didn't need the work after all or never took the time to sit down and write a review.Oh, there's another possibility: According to the upwork blog post, you get a higher percentage if you get repeat work. Well guess what? Not all clients who've ever needed an English-to-Greek translation need another one soon, especially if they came here to ask for it instead of going to a translation agency. But I might still be penalised for it.Finally, let me just say that calculating 'repeat work' is also silly for another simple reason: Most clients I've worked with don't even end contracts, they just keep them going and add extra milestones because they can't be bothered to go throught the same process again. But that doesn't count for repeat work, does it?This is just awful.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

From my personal experience, my JSS fluctuates from 80%, 93%, 100% and NOW back down to 89% within a matter of ONE DAY. Seriously! And no one from Upwork can provide an explanation other than they will forward my ticket to TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

Rest assured Upwork has already invested financial resources to move forward. And from a cost/benefit analysis, they've also calculated that many freelancers will eventually terminate their membership. The ratio of clients to freelancers creates a burdensome task for clients, given the large number of freelancers that apply to a given job. Strategic goals are often not shared. This addresses why explanations given from every level within the Upwork orgaization lacks sound reasoning.

This means clients are having better experiences and coming back for more, which in turn benefits the marketplace and generates more opportunities for freelancers overall. The score helps freelancers at all levels stand out from the competition by presenting clients with a complete picture of their differences. This is an opportunity to help freelancers continue to grow their businesses that we can’t pass up.Please read our blog post here for more information and context on this upcoming change.Additionally, you can learn more about Job Success score and how it's calculated in ourhelp article.You can also read more about improving your score here.**Note, due to recent site issues, we have delayed the timing for this change.

I had 5 contracts so far: 3 ended with 100% succsess and top score, 2 are still in progress. I even got ""Rising Talent"" badge 7 days ago. Everything is going great, you would say.But few hours ago I got email saying that I have lost ""Rising Talent"" badge, with this explanation why:I had no I dea why this happened. I have 100% complete profile, up-to-date availabiltiy status, no account holds, and consistend experience delivery.So, I decided to check my profile, and found out that my Job Success rate dropped down to 88%. I have double-checked all finished contracts, and there was no change in score, everythign is perfect. Then I checked page where ""Job Success"" rate is explained. It mentioned few things that could get score down, but none of them applied to my case. Checked this support page also, but no luck.After that, I have decided to contact support through live chat. Had to wait a little longer, but I managed to reach them online and ask questions. That way, I found out that what decreased my score:That what support staff told me. Reccomend rate (rating) tells if client would reccomend me to other people. It is private feedback given by client. So that's the thing that decreased my success rate significantly.Support guy (or girl) couldn't tell me wich client gave me that rating or how high that rating is, but he told me it is not too low but acceptable. I also learned that client (or anyone else, except fiverr pesonel) can't see or even change that rating.To be honest, I have no idea wich client left that lower reccomend rate, because I did my best on all jobs I worked on, especially because I'm new on Upwork and I really need more jobs and best possible score/rating. All people are different, and I don't have a way to find out why and how client gave me reccomend score lower than 10, and I don't mind, I'm happy because of 5 star score and review for that job (yeah, I don't know wich one is it, but I already mentioned, I have 5 star score on all finished contracts, so thats how I know  ).What is the point of my post here?I have a feeling that this Job Success rate system is a bit unfair to new freelancers. Start is always hard (as I can tell from other people experiences), and people have to wait for some time to get new contract after first one (or first few).New guy here will need even more time to find new job because of one or two private ratings, that client can't change or see, but that affects front-end rating, even if they are between 7 and 10 (for example), wich does not look so bad as 75% or 80% Job Success rate.I think there is some sense to take that rating into account, but it seems to me that it has too big influence on success rate of new freelancers, and it may lead client to wrong conclusion. This applies to all ""hidden and buried forever"" feedbacks/scores. Also, my opinion on whole ""Job Success Score"" thing is not very positive, perhaps it looks good on paper, but in reality - it seems to me that implementation and formula used to calculate score is far from perfect, unfair to freelancers and confusing for clients. You should keep things simple, overly complicated formulas are not solution.Also, I hope this experience I shared with you will be useful to Upwork staff in making system better for everyone.EDIT: Forgot to mention, experience with upwork user support was very good, they are knowledgeable and ready to help and explain things. 10/10 rating ",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

Simply becouse job success soley doesnt meant the freelancer is skilled or not on their respective fields, and awarding them as Top Freelancer based on this only is unwise. Let me give a practical example. lets say am a freelancer with 90% job success score, and I have done 20 jobs so far, and am competing with a 100% job success freelancer who has completed one job. Now this will mean this freelancer is more proffesional than I am which is not neccessary true. This means you telling your upwork clients that this guy is by far the best freelancer you have for that particular job. which ofcourse its not true again. If the freelancer fails to deliver this time, this wont just reflect on him but on all of us becouse, according to upwork he is the best freelancer for the job. Which will lead in clients bealiving upwork has the worse top freelancers.I am a top freelancer with 4.99 stars feedback and a 92% job success score. However I still feel I need to be 100% becouse the one job that was not successful was becouse the client stopped responding. I dont know what happened to him, maybe family crises, we humans things happen. however becouse of my clients inactivity the contract was ended automaticly by upwork as a result, I got 0% job success on that contract which gave me the 92% job success score. Now this doesnt not at all mean I was less skilled for the project. ( Please do try to resolve the manner in which job success score is rewarded. for instance if the clients doesnt specify that the job was unsuccessful, and give a comment on it, then the contract should have no effect on my feedbacks.)In conclusion, what am trying to say is this. rather than removing the 5 stares rather move it down the hierarchy, and job sucess up. I dont see how the 5 stars feedback could have a negatve effect. If you are open for suggestions, rather than removing the ranks that make us Top Freelancer, rather add more ranks, Like after Top Freelancer would be Best freelancer with a little trophy on the side . This would obviously be freelancer with 100% job success score and 5 star feedback for atleast 10 jobs. This is good for your clients, which means its good for you becouse what you saying is that the Best freelancer has greater chance of successfuly completing the project than the Top Freelancer does, which is true. The ranks are fun, its like playing a game and trying to defeat all levels...this motiviates freelancers to make sure they do great so they can be up the rank every time.

While some freelancers leave him 4-5 stars, I saw that HE had left at least to half of his freelancers less than 3 stars. I don't mean to say the situation is entirely your fault, but like you've pointed out you've made a couple of mistakes. Checking out a client and asking all necessary questions should happen before accepting a contract.If you still feel unsure, test the client by having him create a first contract with a small assignment (e.g. just 1 article). If this doesn't go well, give your feedback accordingly and use the commenting function on the feedback they gave you if necessary.And even if it does go well, make sure the contract is closed and feedback is given before accepting another one. Don't let them add to the existing contract because that way you'll always be under the pressure of that one possibly negative feedback.If the client doesn't want to do any of this, don't take them on.The relationship between clients and freelancers is an equal one, each party has their way of conducting business.

I have been here on Upwork for the past about 8 months. I have had 3 completed projects and 3 ongoing ones. The problem here is, according to Upwork algorithm I have to do more work to get a Job Success Score (no fixed number saying how many - vague!).Earlier clients would directly have the average star rating to get an idea about my competency or how good I am working. Now, there's nothing to see, unless they take out their time to dig through my profile (highly unlikely since no one has that much time).Next problem is that Upwork management wants everyone to trust a score without telling how it is reached. No one, neither the freelancers nor the clients have any idea what the Job Success Score means or how it is reached and they will have to decide based on this. I really never came across any client who says that he/she needs ""such & such"" percentage of job success score. Everyone wish to look at the average rating.I may be new to this forum, but I have been working in this particular field for the past 6 years. I am very much professional about my work and my clients. But, just because I always look for a long term relatonship & might not take up hundreds of short term projects, I have no idea when I will have a job success score!Coming back to long term clients - again no idea how that is calculated. Just because 1 client is creating 1 job and providing me new milestones under that particular job Upwork algorithm will probably never consider that person to be my long term client.My request is, instead of creating these ambiguous situatons try to make the platform a little more transparent. I like working here & I get good clients here.

Where is the formula? If there is no formula and it can not be calculated, how you can evaluate people by that system?What I do not like in job success, is that if you have too many open contracts, that you do not work at the moment (some clients have small amount of work for you on every few weeks, or on every few months) you get punished with lowering your job success score. You can not pressure clients to create new contracts on every few weeks for 2 or 3 hours of work?So, you can choose not to work with those clients, or to be punished because your client don't have enough amount of work for you.Also I think that it will artificially give priority to freelancers with lower rating and everybody will have 90-100% job success score and it will make it harder to choose contractor for each job, because the difference will be too small.From my experience users do not like changes and Odesk/Upwork is making too many changes too fast.I hope it won't end bad.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

I might have a nice looking profile now, but just like everyone else I started out looking like a dingbat.To get jobs (I write by the way), I worked diligently to publish work online, and started my own blog so that I could show off good looking work to clients. When I wrote applications, I did so with absolute care, and tried to show the client why I was the best for the job. I had to work for peanuts at first to get a few reviews, and then I put my price up... but not because I had more reviews; just because I realized my own value in the marketplace.Upwork (Odesk back then) has always been a PLATFORM. Mainly the service involves bringing potential clients and potential freelancers together. Potential being the operative word. It was just as hard to get your first few clients a couple of years back as it is now, and it will be just as hard without an overall star rating.Thing is though, if you are really good at what you do, and you choose jobs that match your skills, and you can PROVE it in some way to the client, then you WILL get jobs, and then the ball will be rolling. Rely more on your own skills and know where you stand in the market. This will get you much further than any metric.And besides, if the job success stat proves to be an inaccurate measure of the reliability of a freelancer, then clients will catch on to this. When I am looking for someone to work with I look at everything. The metrics. The profile and what it offers that is unique. The indivudual reviews of each client, so I can see whether people came back for more, and whether they paid high compliments. Everything. Clients who care will do this. Just trust yourself and go with it.I don't know the true motives of the change, or whether it is better for everyone overall all not, but I would say be good at what you do and then prove it to your potential clients, and then please people consistently, and you will be fine.Matt",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Replacing-5-Star-Average-Feedback-with-Job-Success-Score/td-p/106120

VAT Charges for Russia Freelancers and Agencies,3/27/19 11:53,4/18/19 10:13,d6140618d296f29b,CommunityManager,"UPDATE 4/18/19: Upwork will begin collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) from all freelancers and agencies who use Upwork in Russia on April 25, 2019.

Hi everyone, As an update to Russian freelancers and agencies on Upwork, we will soon begin collecting 20% Value Added Tax (VAT) on our fees to all freelancers and agencies in Russia. This change is due to a new law passed in Russia that requires Value Added Tax (VAT) be applied to sales of electronic services from non-Russian businesses (like Upwork) to all Russian consumers and businesses. The 20% VAT will only apply to fees collected by Upwork. This includes service fees on contracts, membership plans, and the purchasing of Connects. The 20% fee DOES NOT apply to withdrawal fees or your contract earnings. Here’s an example of how it would work, assuming the 20% Upwork service fee:Your contract amount$100.00Upwork service fee (including VAT)Upwork freelancer service fee is $100 x 20% = $20 E-services VAT to be paid to the Russian government by Upwork is $20 x 20% = $4Total fees, including VAT, are $20 + $4 = $24 -$24.00Your take-home earnings after fees and VAT$76.00In other words, considering the example above, you will only be charged VAT on the $20 freelancer service fee you pay, meaning you will be charged $4 for VAT. These amounts will appear on your invoices and Transaction History and will be calculated in U.S. dollars. Invoices will also be updated to include Upwork’s INN number.We will update Russian freelancers and agencies directly through email with the timing on when we will begin charging VAT. If you have questions regarding your tax obligations, please consult your tax advisor. For more information on Upwork charging VAT, see this help article.

Insight on how Job Success Score is calculated,4/19/17 20:05,,96789a3f26ace4da,ActiveMember,"I think your ""Job Success Score"" is a very poor measure for the quotient that you call ""job success.""  Please allow me to tell my story.....I have been on Upwork for several years and have never had less than a 5 star review along with many positive comments. I have worked in the industry of animation for 16 years and I take great pride in my work. I have always worked very hard for my clients and have many high satisfaction quality reviews from clients on Upwork and off Upwork. So I naturally took pride in maintaining my 100% Job Success rating as I thought it reflected the reality of what I strived so hard to produce for my clients. Two months ago, my rating suddenly dropped from 100% to 82%. There was no negative feedback from any client. Nothing had happened. I did recognize that a job hand not been closed after almost a two year lull and so I closed it as the client had not closed it. The only other thing I can see is that two jobs from last year were closed with NO feedback. The first individual did not leave feedback even after I asked him to (and my discussion with him can probably be found in my Upwork messages). He stated that he could not leave feedback as he did not know how to do it or where to do it. The second person, a client from last year, (who liked my work and was happy to receive the finished product) tried to cheat me at the satisfactory completion of the project and tried to end a project without paying me. I disputed this and Upwork examined all our correspondence and I won the case and received the escrow payment. Of course, this person did not leave any feedback either. And now I read that contracts that end with no score will affect me negatively. Now because of these two people..one who does not know how to leave feedback and the other who actually tried to cheat me, I have seen my ""Job Satisfaction"" score that supposedly reflects ""successful work done for clients"" plumment to 82% from an ongoing and long standing 100% score. Tell me how is this score represenative of ""Job Success"" if it is dependent on two factors beyond my control?  Your naming of this quotient as ""Job Success"" is a misnomer. It reperesents nothing of the kind.This situation has hurt me and it quite naturally now affects some of my ability to get jobs. I have written Upwork several times and requested an audit of my account. I have gotten no response. Nothing. Also there is no longer a customer service number to call for help in a situation like this. That too is also a shame.I am disappointed in how Upwork is handling this situation. It is affecting me in a very negative way. There is no integrity to a system that would come to penalize a very hard working man who strives hard to maintain excellent work and communication with his clients and has many positive scores to prove it along with a history of a 100% score. There is no integrity in your ""job success score."" I hope someone will see my words and recognize what you are doing.And I hope that someone will see this post and respond accordingly. I do request an audit of my account and a response from Upwork.Thank you for hearing me out.Sincerely,Subhranil Dhar",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Insight-on-how-Job-Success-Score-is-calculated/td-p/87248

As far as I can understand you allow employers to post a good ""public feedback"" and, in the same time, leave a not so good ""private feedback"". I'm not sure if you realize what a toxic practice is this. Many of us are willing to use a honest feedback, no matter how critical, to improve our services and customer care. By hiding a potentially critical feedback you don't allow us to do this. Perhaps it would be better to kick out people that are not able to maintain a decent behavior rather than hide what's unpleasant.- ""paused contracts"". I don't want to push my customers to close a contract for which there is no recent activity or to close it myself, forcing them to leave a feedback. Some people are ""lazy writers"". Perhaps the customer will ask for more work in the future, perhaps he does not care about the paused contract (and this is OK for me). You tend to consider a ""paused contract"" or a contract closed without feedback as an equivalent of a somehow ""bad"" feedback. I'm not sure what kind of statistic calculations / studies do you employ and how accurate are your conclusions. The only valuable feedback, in my opinion, is the feedback customers leave without anyone having to ask them to do so. Please take a moment to read and perhaps realize that you don't encourage trust and honesty with these ""success score"" criteria.

However, upwork proudly says that ""... the calculation is more complex than that simple formula."" What is the need for the complex formula? Why private feedback? As a freelancer can't see a client's feedback unless freelancer gives his feedback, so let the free feedback flow. Why you have to be so secretive that client should share a private feedback with you? That breeds manipulations.Unless I have the transparent feedback, how do I improve? For example, I have executed 13 projects with 4.96 star rating and over $12,000 earnings. All the clients have been extremely satisfied and have been rewarding bonus as high as $1,500. But my JSS was 84%. Recently, when I completed a project and earned a 5star rating with 5% bonus, I was expecting an uptick in the JSS. Surprising my JSS dropped to 80% with no other change in the activity. Can someone explain this?I request Upwork to be transparent in the rating system else scrap the Job Success Score system.

End of project might be too late you might end up with an excellent full score review/praise but your score still drops.Have to do it as daily review, most client will love to do this. refer to free idea below.Using the money taken from service fees Implement something that send an internal review request (viewable by freelancer and client only) to clients daily. So the 'nice' 2 faced client can let us know their concern early so we can react and fix whatever problems they have instead of 2 facing us under the pretense of being nice (what some of us call the half-8*tch client).If client don't fill in the daily review, then his random secret complaints should not hold any power.**bleep** I should charge upwork for my feedbacks they are taking so much in service fees. or maybe I should keep them behind the scene and all secret.Always assumed most client were matured big boys/girls and were matured enough to let us know if there is any mistakes immediatly instead of telling all is great while the project is running but sending secret feedbacks. And worse of all.... then rehiring us again, some even insist on hiring when you reject them because you are overloaded. I will just avoid clients who are nice or too eager to hire me..So this seems to be part of the formula.Awesome review + good comments and praises during WIP communication + excellent full score review and job being completed successfully + rehire for future projects + client acting too nice = the project was not successful due to a secret complaint unknown to freelancer.Thanks.for clearing it up..",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Insight-on-how-Job-Success-Score-is-calculated/td-p/87248

Do you realize how difficult it is for us freelancers to even get good paying work - because most of the jobs out there are either scams or are from people who don't really care about professionalism, freelancer woes, freelancer scores, profiles etc. You need to realize that clients come here simply assuming Upwork as a, 'platform' for getting the job done. They find the right match, they get the job done, they go. Most of them wouldn't even be bothered to give feedbacks and ratings because this system doesn't matter to them. We, the freelancers have to literally badger them, beg them for ratings because this matters to us.For freelancers, Upworkis the very lifeline of their business - and you guys know this just too well. With this knowledge, you exploit the very people that are driving your business. The JSS system is created purely on the grounds of an IF - ELSE, IF-THAT, IF THIS situation. Nothing is concrete. You come up with experiments, force it down our throats, and make it an even more miserable time for us.If I remain inactive, my scores get affected. If I don't get feedbacks from clients who vanish, my score gets affected. If I don't get hired because of geographic prejudice, my scores get affected. If things don't work with the client because of any fault, my scores get affected. If he decides to randomnlyscore me off in a hurry, my scores get affected. So tell me - how does this work for me? Will having a percentage value help me? Weren't the feedback and rating systems enough for that? Why this additional burden too? Unless it's a business ploy.Everything a freelancer does seems to hit back on their profiles and you cannot regulate it, no matter how hopeful you be. There are just so many problems, so many concerns, so many flaws with the JSS system and you know it already - but you're insistent on making it difficult for us. You really need to understand that in the real world, Upwork is merely a website that offers jobs - and that's about it. So if you think you can get clients to treat freelancers well or if you think you are really are making it better for us to get good jobs, you're so wrong.

No proposal answered or, if so, wanting to lower the budget, whereas on Elance, my carefully constructed proposals received a super high percentage of acceptance.Same exact issues with migration, 100% recommended with Elance longevity, 5-Star rating, admin-business ops work. Virtual work has become my livelihood. My clients rely on me. I rely on them. NO issues with payments - incoming or outgoing - that alone is worth an investigation of Upwork 'holding monies' to 'verify and confirm' already-established clients and contractors. How transparent.Thank you for taking the time to delineate your experience and setting forth the issues - I haven't seen one nor could I have written a better set of issues to address on all fronts. . Hopefully, by some quirk of luck, your descriptive narrative will find its way to the boardroom. It is precise and succinctly outlines the issues. Coming from a career background involving mergers and acquisitions, I have never seen such a disastrous set of circumstances. A goodly portion of this is not only due to the technical issues of the platform, but with the JSS having been refined by a statistician who doesn't 'get' it. Contractors are being penalized for short-term projects or for lack of feedback or for....something.... we're just not quite sure, because...... it's a SECRET! Really? Not the way grown-ups do business.Clients are now expressing opinions that rather than tussle with the Upwork platform and its inane systems that ultimately have a negative impact for not only them, but their contractors, establishing an entirely new platform utilizing the Elance model and screening Clients very very carefully as well as contractors might be justifiable. They're fearful of losing or not being able to find their loyal, highquality contractors due to the hostile approach that Upwork has taken with its Contractors. These are highly experienced eCommerce clients who know what they're doing (understand the attendant issues of profit/loss) and were extremely happy with Elance and the high quality of contractor found on Elance. (Yes, there are good contractors on o'desk, but even those with a modicum of success are now finding their livelhoods in jeopardy due to the JSS and Upwork manipulations.)Isn't it amazing how our job proposals on Elance were considered worthy of project/job award with good budgets and schedules, and the invites just kept coming, but the folks at o'desk/upwork seem to think that 'we need to try just a bit harder' to find jobs?

Upwork this they have make and advanced change for good trying to move into the future but it has completely failed. The CEO needs to think before he acts because this system in nothing but an abomination and an easy way to alienate those with a star rating 4 and below. This sytem was implimented to (Clean House). Those not worthy of Upwork were out casted right away as soon as the success score was implimented. The 5 star rating system and the succes score system completely contradict each other which means nothing good comes with two rating systems in place. In order for Upwork to be a better place, Upwork needs to give community votes before causing more damage to it's self. give the feelancers a chance to vote for change and to only make change based on their votes. The reason why is because employers on upwork are not interested in working with anyone below an 80% success score rating. People who are hired with a 75% should consider themselves extremely lucky that they were even hired. All upwork did was completed weed out the unsuccessfull people and keep the most productive people. Upwork cannot deny this fact because that is what is happening now. More than 15,000 peopl accross the globe are complaining because of such a horrible system that was put in place without a community freelancer vote. If anyone is wondering how the success score works, this pretty much sums it up. If you have anything under a 75% success score rating, you might a well go to another freelancer sight because your chances of being hired are completely damaged. I had a client that didnt provide any feed back and that was way before the sucess score was implimented. once the success score was implimented, my job success score automatically registered at 55% and I have been fighting to find a job for more than 6 months and every job application I tried to apply for has been denied all because of a low success rating. Regarding statistics, 97% of employers on Upwork do not read what the Job success score really is. which is why it was designed to fail.

Freelancers are your consumers. What kind of business gives their own consumers rating (secretly or openly)?? If Upwork officials cannot sleep without rating someone, then clients are the ones they should rate.Does it not seem counterintutive to you? What say?I don't entirely agree. If you go somewhere and purchase a service, would you feel that your customer should rate you, or that you can rate them? This is the way Upwork handles it. Clients (the customers) are able to influence the ratings of the freelancers (who are service providers), but the reputation of the customers is taken into consideration when determining the amount of influence.Let me frame it differently.You're a routine customer of Wal Mart - then one day you shop at Macy's for whatever reason. You think Wal Mart is just grand, but your complaints about Macy's are that they are too expensive, too specialized, etc. Your opinion on Macy's shouldn't reflect as heavily as the perpetual Macy's customers. Moreso, someone who's never shopped in any department store whatsoever and tries to get a $500 jacket for $10 should be figured in when they are dissatisfied with what they get for $10. Maybe they truly aren't satisfied - that's fine - but there's a chance that they're just being overly demanding. Depends on how they respond to other stores in the area.Pardon me if I'm just being naive because I'm new (I don't have a JSS of my own, yet) but... Putting it this way sort of makes sense, to me at least. This is just a generic explanation/comparison of how I understand the JSS to be calculated and I make no claims of being an expert at this system.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Insight-on-how-Job-Success-Score-is-calculated/td-p/87248

I can't tell like ""thanks for raising my rate, now please give me a 5-star feedback"" I am sure that both clients and freelancers would feel much more comfortable to be able to manage their contracts on their own. I also agree with otherfreelancers that this is not professional to ask a client to close the contract and to leave a feedback.And also Upwork (not freelancers!) should be more persistant to get the feedbacks. Send reminders etc.So as you can guess I have a bunch of such inactive contracts (some of them are more than a year old) I now I need to think of such silly things like what is better - to keep them inactive or to close and get ""no feedback"".

This includes private and public feedback, long-term relationships, rehires, and contracts that do not result in work delivered. The goal is to capture a breadth of information not necessarily reflected in youraverage 5-star rating. Because of this wider breadth of information, there's greater differentiation among freelancers and their scores. With average 5-star Feedback, this was harder to come by. That is, you found a lot of freelancers lumped together with 4.8's, 4.9's, 5's. This made it harder for clients to identify the best freelancers and for those freelancers to find more work.Displaying Job Success scores has helped with this. It helps freelancers stand out from the competition by presenting clients with a complete picture of freelancers’ differences. When we implemented Job Success scores in testing, clients hired more of Upwork’s top freelancers, and freelancers were able to be more selective in accepting contracts.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/FAQs-about-Removing-5-Star-Average-Feedback/td-p/113508

That is, you found a lot of freelancers lumped together with 4.8's, 4.9's, 5's. This made it harder for clients to identify the best freelancers and for those freelancers to find more work.""Garnor is right. There are several research papers available on the web pointing out this issue: reputation scores areskewed towardshigh ratings, making them less useful to identify top workers.While I do understand this, it seems to me that there's still something that ought to be done in order for Upwork to fully implement the new score as the only score shown. Several examples have been presented in this forum that clearly show that there's something that is not working the way it should. This being the case, I would then say that it seems wise not to remove the star rating before these problems have been solved. Once they're solved, neither freelancers nor clients would be presented withinconsistencies, and everyone would accept the advantages of JSS.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/FAQs-about-Removing-5-Star-Average-Feedback/td-p/113508
Local Hiring Update and New Feature,7/18/18 20:29,,b3414a5396ccbff3,Moderator,"Hi Igor,Could you please clarify on your comment, I'm not sure if you're seeing it on your job feed?I would just like to clarify thatUpwork does not allow discrimination against color, race or national origin. If a client expresses a preference in a job post that is discriminatory, they are in violation of our Terms of Service and we will take action and remove those job posts. We allow clients to search and hire based on the freelancer’s location because we recognize that some projects may require localized knowledge, work within certain time zones, or other factors that require the freelancer be in a specific location. With this new feature, we hope to meet the needs of clients who need talent within their own country. By doing so, we hope to get them started on Upwork before opening the door to future projects that can be done globally.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Local-Hiring-Update-and-New-Feature/td-p/444904

When you are ready to expand this feature to other countries, please pass on my concern about the following, so that thesystem can be programmed to take it into account:a) For translation jobs regionality may be important or it may not, but some clients (most, in my opinion) are not aware of linguistic differences or similarities (as this tends to be an educational niche subject). For instance, German (my area of work) is spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland,... A client looking for a ""German translator"" may think that because of the obvious correspondence between the country and the language name, that it would make sense to click on ""location: Germany"" only. Now, I don't know about other providers on here, but none of my clients have felt the need to convert my translations to a dialectal variant spoken in Germany or to make the German dialectal audios more easy to understand for me.So: Make it easy for clients to choose if they have the expertise to choose wisely, but give them a choice that doesn't disadvantage some providers.",Unedited,Announcements,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/Local-Hiring-Update-and-New-Feature/td-p/444904

It's hard enough now to get decent jobs coming up in the feeds, and I only look for jobs that pay the rate I want. There are top-ratedfreelancerswho make really generic proposals that they copy and paste, and they just post it really quickly. They don't listen to the client's needs at all! I've even had some clients say to me, ""I am going to show you some other proposals, they are a joke"" because they stuck them up quickly and didn't edit them. So now the client will only get a selection of the people who bid first and top rated ones who do the same stuff all the time!What's up with the whole renewal thing? It looks terrible, the posts are saying they hired someone and it's super confusing if they have someone or not because it's still open and says renewed!To me as a freelancer, making a custom proposal as much as I can and taking a little time to write it really makes the difference in getting hired and then ovbiously spending the time on the job to make it good quality is equally important. So now, I have to rush to make sure I can get my proposal in because the job will just disappear once there are so many proposals?It also means I have to be here at all times refreshing the page to find work, and I honestly can't do that all the time because I am working to make good quality work for my clients!This doesn't make any sense, just like the US only stuff. You are making it harder forgood freelancers to get good freelance jobs here! Especially for those who are not in the US! The platform is completely unbalanced with the way you are setting up these ""perks"".I also want to add, I totally disagree with you saying that it unlikely you can win a job that has a lot of proposals.

Now, freelancers WILL HAVE TO work with any projects (not only interesting) just to earn something;- Now, freelancers should spend theirmost expensive that they have — time, to monitor and be in first 20 to be among the first who applied for the job;- Now the reward is received by those who have applied first (what is then the feature of Rated?);- If we take a freelancer that earned $1k, don't have TR, just 10+ hours and his rate is $15/hour and another freelancer, who has $50k, TR and 1000+ hours with his rate $45/hour — the 1st one will win the job just because he applied earlier 🤷‍♂️ (at this moment, seriously Upwork, this is how you're going to help the clients and freelancers?)-The level of hiring can fall significantly, because the client simply will not find a suitable candidate (he doesn't have to spend his budget only because on his work were applied in a hurry);- The clients DON'T want ""less proposals"", they WANT lessuseless proposals (from copy-paste cover letters of robo-bidders).So what happens now: I should spend much moremy personal time for what, for being Online here and search the job just for earn something this month?Now, Ihave to apply fornot interesting projects just to win them and earn something this month?Every time you introduce such innovations you make freelancers worried:-Won't a freelancer be banned for applying on too many projects without winning them?;- When afreelancer will get that ""letter of happiness""?-What will happen if a freelancer declines too many invites?

Testing a Change to Job Feeds & Search Results to Support Top Rated Freelancers,7/10/18 4:32,,569a4ec0de467934,ActiveMember,"Hello everyone. This is my opinion:- Only 20% of the usual posts are visible now and that will push away 80% of the freelancers because they will have nothing to bid on unless they check in every 20 min the new job posts. Good freelaners dont have time for that and the bidders wont be any better than before. it will be hard for the client to choose again from 15-20 proposals who to hire.- Clients wont award projects more than before. The % will decrease I think and Upwork will have to bring back to old way. Its not normal to hide job posts. Some clients may want to have it longer displayed to attract more people. 50% of the clients way 2-3 days or 1 week before they hire someone. They want more applicants so they can choose better freelancers.- If Upwork keeps running this test for another 2-3 weeks or 1-2 months the website will loose most of its freelancers and clients. It will bring Upwork 15 years back. From the largest freelance website to a startup level website. It will take 1-2 years to bring back the freelancers and clients and reputation. This test is killing the website.- People use it because its working well. If its working well you dont make such a massive change. It will be working even better if fee is 10% fore frelancers, not 20%. But thats another topic.-Already 4-5 clients of mine told me that they will not post a new job in Upwork because of the new test. They dont like the fact that their job post will be hidden in 30-40 minutes. They dont like the fact that will have only 15-20 bidders.What i suggest is to bring the old way of the job feed this week. If you wait few more weeks will be a massive damage to Upwork.

"Freelancer rude, bullying, demanding money without work completion and blaming me for his mistakes",3/14/21 7:40,,a881a78b5c48834d,AceContributor,"update : for the forum which is public facing. Someone will get in touch, moderator or community guru will get in touch rather fast. But not sure if they are staffs or upwork or just some ambassadors that serve as eyes and ears or upwork. However, despite this getting the attention from one of the staff directly from upwork, all she can do is say she will investigate but cannot share the finding. So basically an action to pacific you - they can ignore the fact and you are still none the wiser.Also, i gave a 1 star review and yet the freelancer is still 100% work success. Later asked the advice from a friend who's a freelancer too. Turns out very easy to create fake reviews.

If a freelancer told you he was passing on the expense to you, then you were free to decline he rate/proposal. 3.5% is a processing fee, not a commission. Your bank charges similar fees for processing credit card payments.You did not properly vet your freelancer, then you did not fire them when they could not perform. Know the adage ""hire slowly, fire fast."" You seem to have done the opposite.Upwork is a platform to connect, but they are not supervisors of freelancers. When you hire a freelancer it is up to you to supervise them, and there are plenty of rules in place to protect clients, if you follow them.If you want your money back you can ask the freelancer for a full refund, or you can try for a dispute, if it was fixed price and not hourly. You can dispute hours on an hourly contract if you're still within the window.As a client, when you close the contract you can also leave feedback for the freelancer, and this significantly impacts their profile on Upwork. You have a lot of power, which you don't seem to realize.

So, technically, yes you can sue Upwork because you can sue anybody for anything. It's a matter of filing paperwork.Fuller answer: You are not going to to sue Upwork because Upwork reveals your name in exactly the same way that Upwork reveal's every freelancer's name, and in exactly the same way that you were informed your name would be displayed when you read Upwork's ToS. You are not going to find an attorney who will take your case, because you are not willing to pay an attorney the amount of money it would cost to take on such a case, and no attorney is willing to take the case on for free. Also: You will not sue because you are basically a good and moral person, and such a lawsuit would be immoral.

You would receive $100 immediately, you would have my gratitude, and there would be no more work for you to do.""Alexander: I think this method has a reasonably high probability of success in getting some money back.You ALSO have the option of simply releasing all the funds and closing the contract, and there is NOTHING that the freelancer could do about it.If the freelancer does NOT agree to a refund, you can STILL REQUEST a refund. You could request half. Or you could request ALL of the escrow money back. But remember, if you request ANY refund, the option will be sent to the freelancer to agree or disagree. That is why I recommend discussing any possible refund requests with the freelancer BEFORE you close a contract, in order to secure the freelancer's cooporation first.",Unedited,Clients,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/A-freelancer-doesn-t-meet-deadlines/td-p/884057

I have a question for you, please. How can I see all these jobs and some of the freelancers you worked with? My experience so far is terrible. I have talked to so many freelancers who are either terrible on the manners side, or could not do the job (no skill). I created an account on Upwork last week on Saturday/Sunday and I have been contacting freelancers ever since, that's what I have been doing for the last 3 days, about 8 hours a day! and... no success at all.

I am a client.,3/10/21 21:46,,990669075c17c592,AceContributor,"I don't normally respond to comments in the forum, just read, but I feel like I need to respond to this one. I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator for over twenty five years. Full disclosure, I am a proud Upwork Freelancer. In my business career, I have written and signed many different types of contracts for my artwork, exclusive rights, time sensitive rights, NDA rights, etc. I would not have a problem signing a full copyright transer and original work contract. Like I said, I've done it many times before. Full copyrights cost extra, work for hire original artwork cost extra. That is the plain simple truth. If you pay cheap, good for you but beware.I was very insulted that Freelancers should get paid less because they are not brick and mortar. We pay for all our work supplies including thousands of dollars for software, office supplies, computer, software, internet, water, electricity, health insurance, self-employment tax, tax preparer, accountant, etc. Some freelancers also have a brick and motar businees in additon to being a freelacer on Upwork. The problem is that clients don't understand what they want or what that is worth. By the way paying $400 for a logo is really cheap. Someone I know works for a company that just paid 1.5 million for a logo upgrade. I feel like Petra and Preston gave real solid adivce as did others.You, as a client made a huge mistake. You wrote your job desciprtion as one sentence. (I know this because I saw the job post, you invited me and I decliened it) You only said that you needed a cover for a notebook/journal, no description, target market, style, etc. How can you expect any responses from serious freelancers without a more detailed description? You need to put more words in your description about what the job is about. What kind of illustration\design? What is the subject matter? Also, let them know in the description, that you are only looking for original artwork that you can copyright. Upwork can be a geat tool for your business, but you have to do some work yourself to find the best fit.",Unedited,Clients,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Question-for-graphic-designers-I-am-a-client/td-p/880506

I thought I got a great deal.And check out this work by Upwork artist Easter Joyce Diaz. Her rate is $10/hour. (That means she earns about twice the typical hourly pay that a hospital staff doctor earns in her country.) The total cost was $68.33:The cost for this work byRaheela Saleem (for a potluck dinner invitation) was $36.25:This is some phenomenal work as far as I'm concerned. I have obtained a ton of great work from Upwork artists. I have also hired local artists from my community. But I mostly hire through Upwork because it is a more reliable source. Even if the rates are the same, I have had a far better experience with dealines and turnaround time when hiring through Upwork.I'm not here to tell anybody they shouldn't pay artists well.But I don't feel guilty when I post a job and an artist applies to the job and I pay her using her hourly rate.",Unedited,Clients,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Question-for-graphic-designers-I-am-a-client/td-p/880506

Question for graphic designers. I am a client.,3/10/21 13:02,,a33bed79bf7fa12d,CommunityGuru,"Preston,Regarding your answer in which you mention that ""I pay artists their posted hourly rates or what they ask for fixed-price commissions. To be brutally honest: the costs tend to be shockingly low."" ... Hmmm... I've been quoted $40-$50 to $150 per hour. That is not at all low. That is actually pretty expensive at it matches any other real shop in my town. That shop pays rent, salaries, and has expenses associated with maintaing a real business, so it is expected to have higher fees. Based on these ""shockingingly low"" prices as you call them, a logo can end up costing up to $450-$500, which is pretty high. If I need a cover for a presentation file, a logo, and a visit card, all that can cost me up to $2000 based on the quotes I received. That is not cheap at all and the high price comes with no contract to protect me for future lawsuits.Obviously freelancers don't pay rent, don't eat, and don't have any other expenses associated with maintaining a real business. Can these folks even be considered real businesses lol.Anyway, I observe that the issue is not that the freelancersrefusedto sign a custom IP agreement and/or non-compete contract whenyou offered one.You don't have a contract ready, and these freelancers don't normally work with custom contracts. Indeed, they appear to have found success working with clients using Upwork's default terms, to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.As the one who needs such a contract, you should have one prepared and offer that they sign it.If they then refuse to sign your contract, we can then have a discussion as to why.Upwork's ToS clearly acknowledge the freedom of contract between client and freelancer and even encourages them to sign a custom one if they see it fit.",Unedited,Clients,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Question-for-graphic-designers-I-am-a-client/td-p/880506

Many/most larger clients want to diversify. They don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, even with a really great freelancer.My husband is in marketing and he does this all the time for another reason: he wants more than one ""voice"" on his company's site, and people specialize in different things, with some better at writing about one subject than another.I have had clients who hired additional freelancers for long-term jobs. I have times when I'm not available and they wanted to fill in those times. That made total sense to me. These clients continue to return with new jobs/keep jobs open with new milestones.

Certainly in the corporate space I have had employees or contractors whom I needed to replace but had to do so discretely. Alerting them to this too early would jeopardizethe business. This doesn't mean they would necessarily do anything malicious, but at the same time it was unlikelyI would receive even the lower value I felt I was getting if they knew the situation. This is mostly about someone currently working for you and not about someone who worked for you prior. This isn't a ""feelings"" thing but a need to protect current business. It is not an unreasonablerequest and could be facilitatedby entering the freelancer you don't want the post to be visible to and the system will filter it from the freelancer's view. Of course this is not perfect as they could still see it if they were looking from someone else's account or perhaps via other means but it's not a perfect process elsewhere either.

The money then goes into escrow until the freelancer submits the work and you approve the milestone or 14 days pass, when the money is released to the freelancer. The charge you see was not for the 2nd milestone, but for funding the third. You can't activate a milestone without funding it.",Unedited,Clients,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Free-lancer-is-working-on-last-milestone-money-already-in-escrow/td-p/883383

However, for the invoice that was already generated, we cannot change it. Because we want your invoices to always show your name, address, etc., as you had it listed at that time, we do not add your updated information to past invoices. This is for accuracy and to ensure that your invoices reflect the same information as they did on the day they were created. Also, if you live in certain areas, we must collect taxes, such as sales or VAT.

Freelancer is unable to complete the project and negative attitude,3/3/21 8:40,3/3/21 12:00,d324e45037dc32fc,CommunityGuru,"re: ""So, now, I am about $2000 in the red, no Web App, no Mobile App, Freelancer is quiet, and I should just walk away and lick my wounds?""I am sorry that you had a disappointing experience while using Upwork.If used properly, the largest amount of money that a client can expect to lose in situations such as the one you describe is about $100.You should absolutely feel free to use the Community Forum, including this very thread, to ask questions in order to help you understand the mistakes that you made so that you can avoid making those same mistakes again in the future.But to help you out, I will provide some information even before you ask additional questions:re: ""So, new to Upwork, I signed up in November, hired a Freelancer Resource in India, and he started working.""Why did you only hire one freelancer?That was a mistake for a project this large.How did you expect to compare the work done by different people if you only hired one?This was for a mobile app and a web app? But you didn't hire an independent project manager?That was a mistake.A project of this scope and size is quite significant. It is highly unlikely that the project will succeed unless you have an independent project manager working on it.All projects of this size have a project manager. If you (as the project owner) do not hire an independent project manager, and if you don't act as the project manager yourself, then the project manager by default is the lead developer. But only about 20% of lead developers can function as project manager. So if you hired one of the 80% who can't, then it means (by definition) that your project will fail.re: ""I soon discovered, after wondering WHY he was having such problems understanding English or delivering anything that worked...""If you felt that understanding English and/or delivering something that works were important characteristics in a freelancer working on this project, then why did you continue working with this freelancer when you found that he lacked these characteristics?re: ""in frustration, on 31st December 2020, or 01.01.2021, i filed a dispute""I don't blame you for becoming frustrated. For future reference, plan to never file a dispute. The concept of a ""dispute"" leads clients to have a false sense of security, as if they have some kind of ""get out of jail free"" card. But disputes don't help clients create mobile apps and web apps. Disputes just waste a client's time. The dispute process is primarily meant to be used by freelancers, not by clients.A better approach is this mantra:""I am the client. I have total control over my project and who works on it. I will never file a dispute. Instead, I will have my project manager proactively review the work submitted by all freelancers, especially when they are new on the project. If any freelancer's work doesn't measure up, then I will stop working with them.""In other words: Don't send money to freelancers and then ask for the money back. Instead: Fire underperforming freelancers and don't send them that money in the first place.This is more easily done if you hire using hourly contracts or small initial fixed-price contracts. You don't need to set up a $1000 contract with a freelancer you have never worked with before. Instead, set up a $50 contract to do the first step. The freelancer understands that this is the first step in a $1000 project. She submits the first step, your project manager reviews it, and if you love it, you fund the next step. If you don't love the work, then you thank the freelancer for her time and end the contract.re: ""And yes, I am very curious about American No-Win-No-Fee lawyers to take on Upwork on this single, narrow point. I'm just a Google search away.""You may indeed be able to find an attorney who will work for you on an hourly basis. You will not find an attorney who will work on this case on a ""no-win-no-fee"" basis. Because attorneys want to be get paid for their time, and no attorney is going to believe there is any way that she can earn any money from this case on a no-win-no-fee basis. Moreover, no attorney will take this case on a pro-bono basis.re: ""Tell me why it is ok for some guy, who only met me through and because of Upwork, walk away with my money and I am left holding nothing. Tell me why, please.""It is NOT okay.Nobody here is going to defend a freelancer who behaved inappropriately. It is highly likely that you encountered a bad freelancer.But if you spent $2000 and received nothing, it is because you used the Upwork platform incorrectly.Upwork set up a system specifically to prevent what you describe from happening. For hourly contracts, clients are able to review work every week and dispute inappopriately billed hours or ANY manually-logged time. Clients can end a contract AT ANY TIME for ANY REASON. Clients can pause a contract at any time to prevent additional billing. For fixed-price contracts, clients can review the work submitted and NOT PAY until they are satisfied that the the work has been completed properly.Why did you decide to NOT use the client protections built into the system?You may read more about your situation here:Is Upwork's messaging to clients inadequate?

Please stop asking me to skype!!,6/10/16 7:43,,f5b711946311e420,AceContributor,"I freelance and hire on Upwork. When Isubmit proposalsfor workI neitherrequest Skype info nor do I offer my own. Is it not a violation of TOS to to do so in the initial RFP?  I must say, however, over the years I've had plenty of clients respond asking ME to hook up with them on Skype to further discuss their projects.  In some cases it's absolutely crucial, because the client has been unable to clearly expound their needs. And I think we all agree, there's nothing more bothersome than a project that goes sideways due to poor communication. I agree it's in poor taste and highly unprofessional to insist on Skype conversations in the initial RFP...not to mention a violation of TOS as I understand it.  On those rare occasions when I seea particular job that piques my interest, but the description is vague, I will ask specific questions and inform the prospective client that I am available on Skype should they feel more comfortable talking about their needs in person. I DO NOT, however, post my Skype ID. On the flip side, some of those clients who immediately respond by insisting on a Skype conference either want to take the job off platform, or whittle down my rate.  In both cases it's a sure bet they won't remain Skype contacts for very long. When I've hired for projects I have receivedthe occasional Skype request from freelancers. They're mostly non-western culture applicants and seem overly eager to get work...any work. These are challenging times. In a matter of weeks, we're all going to face a huge rate hike. Plus, recent changes removing transparency in job postings have already made vetting of clients even more difficult. So, don't be too surprised when the less experienced and uninitiated freelancers push for Skype conversations as a way to gain some kind of competitive edge...at least in their minds.

I know some designers on Upwork are already doing it, but can't it be applied to other job categories as well?In this way, you take the time to think of the crucial questions before you met the client. So when you meet via Upwork (or not), instead of discussing first-time on Skype, you give the client the questionnaire. The questions are well-structured and carefully planned. When you read the answers, you will know what you're dealing with. No 'hum' or 'errrrr', or 'What do you mean?' etc. on Skype. Just straightforward questions.In case something isn't clear when you receive the answers, you merely clarify on Skype for like 5-10mins.You can be ready to start working after that. So far it's working like a charm for me. Sparing me so much time in asking the same questions over and over again. I'm also setting up a document (well-designed  so it's pleasing for the eye) to explain my overall work process and what type of clients I work with (and other things).So, instead of talking about how I approach the job every time, I just hand the client this document. He reads it and in 5 mins he has an idea about me. Again, sentences are short, presentation clear and no time-wasting skype calls. I feel like a schizophrenic explaining myself over and over and over again.In any case, like I said, it may not work for every type of job, but I think it's possible for any freelancer to prepare a few docs and use them for clients on Upwork. I know that most clients don't read (or it's just in minor occasions) our profile overviews (where I've briefly explained myself), so I can't possibly count on that.

The last updated date would be useful on JSS-update day, if it actually updated at the same time as JSS did. But, it updates hours before the stats change, so it's really meaningless.Recent account holds and TR eligible weeks? I can see how that's useful to someone trying to get to TR, but once someone is TR, there's no need for it to be displayed.Communication section: the number of invites is interesting only for curiosity. A trend graph would make it more useful, but even so, it's not all that important.Marketing effectiveness: this can go. Without more context, it's meaningless. I was viewed slightly less often than people in Writing? Ok, that's fine, but that's a pretty broad category, so I don't know why I should care. But the green bar for interviewed is close to full? How does that make sense with the viewed graph being so low? Without details of how it's calculated, this looks wrong and untrustworthy. And I was hired a bit more often than average?

I vaguely remember it's related to search, but that's it. And it often goes to 0 for weeks at a time, when I know my profile is getting viewed cause I'm getting invites. It also never agreed with the other discovery graph that I used to get emails about, but I can't find that one at the moment.Profile completeness? Why does this need a progress bar? And how is it related to the discovery graph? It's not, but the placement on the screen makes it look like it is. All this merits is a percentage on the side bar of the profile edit view. That's the only place it's relevant.The more detailed breakdown of stats that Phyllis and Jennifer have suggested would be useful, especially if they came with trend graphs or drilldowns. But I'm really not sure how much I'd pay attention to them. And don't put in comparisons other freelancers, like the current effectiveness graphs. That's meaningless unless it can be narrowed down significantly: academic/technical editors in my price range. I'd really just want to see my raw numbers and a trend. I don't really care how I'm doing vs others.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/How-can-we-improve-My-Stats-Share-your-feedback/td-p/863487

This is generally done to avoid the feedback received influencing the feedback that is being left and is commonly called ""double blind feedback""That´s exactly right, Petra. So what is the rationale for showing the feedback after 14 days, if only one party has left such for the other? Double-blind doesn´t mean ""for a limited period of time"" and besides, if Upwork wants to treat both sides of the working relationship equitably, as it often tries to make us believe, it should handle feedback visibility the same on both sides.In any case, the ""No feedback given"" from that client does not affect my score in any way (it´s 100%), but I do care about proportionality. I have asked Upwork to retract my feedback, which it did. The customer support person who helped me acknowledged the need for Upwork to do better in terms of how it handles feedback.**Edited for Community Guidelines**",**Edited**,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Feedback-Review-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/td-p/4389

Altho I think it does after a period of time if one party chooses not to play nicely.#3 Is it really affecting your ability to win new clients seeing you got this client without their review? So how does having or not having this review really change your future chances of winning a similar client?Number 3 is really the important one here as your work is what matters most, not statistics.

When do I qualify for JSS and a badge?,1/29/21 8:47,,fc9332ce6e600816,ActiveMember,"I have to agree that that makes no sense: It sounds like Upwork is basically rewarding people for switching jobs constantly. Basically saying you get a ""high"" score for doing 4-5 different jobs in 24 months but get a ""low"" score for keeping the same 1-2 clients for 3-4 years. It would seem to me a freelancer that can KEEP a client for multiple YEARS is more ""successful"" than a freelancer that does 20+ small gigs in a few months, bouncing around everywhere. If somebody has been working ""full time"" with the same 1 or 2 clients for several years, that should not translate into a ""negative"" job success score: It actually means the freelancer was VERY successful if their client has kept them around so long. I think part of the issue is that Upwork makes more money when you start a NEW contract and they get to take 20% off the top, but the longer you work for the same client, the less and less they take. After you earn $10,000 with a client, Upwork only gets 5% - so changing jobs often definitely makes Upwork ""successful"" from a profit standpoint, but it's questionable if frequent job changes makes a freelancer ""successful"", especially if they aren't getting many repeat clients",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/When-do-I-qualify-for-JSS-and-a-badge/td-p/842398

This option is only for notification on the community page.3. Bid is just an option in the hourly job proposal, you can bid your price while others do for the same job, maybe some clients have no idea about how much hourly to charge for a job or they want to do the job for the lowest hourly rates, so this option also decides whether you will get the job or not.I hope this is helpful.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Locked-private-Profile/td-p/405044

Having your profile set to private doesn't stop you from submitting proposals, and the clients who receive your proposals will still be able to see your profile. It just means that your profile won't appear in search results, so you won't receive any invitations to submit proposals. But if you're new to Upwork you're unlikely to receive useful invitations anyway. Moreover, Upwork will reset your profile to public on request.

Locked private Profile,9/18/19 8:59,,c7bd49a67259dde6,ActiveMember,"Hello,After some time I got my account with great 100 % job success, top freelancer and getting only projects which are with decent pay. Still not as much as a company outside of Upwork but I can't complain since I work both ways.I got a few regular customers which are always coming for more work including two projects which are ongoing and pilling money for Upwork.Here is where the problem I am pondering on stands at.Everyone went on vacation and the projects just stopped for a bit which is totally normal.The consequence, however, is that Upwork decided to make my 100 % top-rated account not visible because I didn't take upon any **bleep**ty job they threw at me and kindly requested me to pay them or to start generating again.From where I am standing they should make people who actually earn for them to come back in a nice way. Instead, it turns out that they give me some sort of sanction.When I look at it like that it makes me a bit concerned and frustrated.Well mainly frustrated.Is this a place to actually be checking for development and jobs or I should pull out all those clients I have to the outside and just wave goodbye.Tell me what you guys think.Cheers.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Locked-private-Profile/td-p/405044

In the last month I a have send 12 proposals, got 3 job offers and accepted 3 job offers. Not bad for a beginner. Yes, I was not paid yet, but that is due to unresponsiveness from my clients. One already apologized for that. He was busy.Making my profile invisible for clients will not improve my opportunity to get new job offers. So, what is the point?

I only freelance part-time on here (due to being a full-time student and also having clients outside the platform who often keep me busy enough) so there are often gaps of some weeks or months when I don't actively look for/accept jobs. Regardless, it's annoying that the platform then chooses to make my profile completely hidden, preventing me from getting exceptionally interesting offers that I might accept despite not being actively on the lookout.

As a result, they save absolutely random jobs, so “similar jobs” emails are completely irrelevant to their actual interests.My job feed is already loaded with irrelevant jobs at 97-99%, so I do not need an extra flood of irrelevant jobs, now delivered via email.Why any new Upwork “features” and updates make the system worse and worse?

You can find more information about it here.Yes, but this is information that the freelancer has obtained from a non-Upwork client and therefore it's the freelancer's privacy policy that must state that the freelancer may pass on the client's (identificable) personal data to a third party for marketing reasons. This has nothing to do with Upwork's privacy policy.Let me elaborate:Let's say I work for Company X outside of Upwork. Through that work I obtain misc. data that I process (e.g. email address). My privacy policy stating how I handle/store such data is between myself and Company X.If I suddenly pass on this information to Upwork for the sake of having a non-Upwork client's testimony on my Upwork profile, I must first pass on personal data to Upwork (required by Upwork), however, the client needs to be made aware of that at the time they give me the data (or as a minimum, I must update my privacy policy to state explicitly that data will be passed on to third party for marketing reasons and that how third party handles, processes, stores that data is described by third party's privacy policy which is no concern of mine) and it therefore has to be described in my privacy policy, if not when entering a work contract with Company X, then in an update prior to passing on the data to Upwork.I don't think Upwork has made its freelancers aware of this and freelancers may unintentionally be violating various privacy laws by filling in Upwork's form in order to get off-site testimonials on to Upwork.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Non-Upwork-Client-Testimonials/td-p/704529

That is a nasty practice. I deal with many overseas clients that do not use LinkedIn or many other more western-centric social media platforms and so this practice really does penalize us. What's more, many of us have already received endorsements well before joining Upwork, and to go and ask those people again, and some after many years is not a really acceptable practice.Also, unfortunately some of my endorsers are no longer with us, but that should not discredit the value of the endorsement or the work done to earn it.There needs to be a better way to add 'Unverified' Endorsements maybe under another section.See attached for endorsements I have received outside of Upwork.

While any verification process of Upwork clients we share here on the platform is absolutely understandable in terms of what do Upwork require to approve a linked project in our profile showcase section, when it comes to clients which Upwork has no connection with - I think a slightly more transparency on the process might encourage freelancer to use the feature and will not hurt its integrity. Upwork cans till verify anything they wish while the freelancer will be assured there is no invasion of privacy to their own clients.Working in Upwork for a few years now, I know that Upwork always do the right thing, always improves processes in the fairest and most convenient way to both freelancers and employers which is so different than any other freelancing platforms - and I am sure this process can be fine-tuned in a slightly less secretive way to ensure freelancers that they are not putting their clients in any form of uncomfortable situation where they are both want to help the freelancer in their personal profile on Upwork platform but to do so, they might feel their privacy is been invaded.just food for thoughts, I guess.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Non-Upwork-Client-Testimonials/td-p/704529

The overall process was a bit hard as all branch senior staff was unable to understand things. My purpose code issue was resolved by the Centralized Remittance Department of HBL. Let me explain to you how things work:1. Freelancers should not worry about tax exemption but they should care about their documentation to prove that their income source is remittance. For this purpose, FBR may need encashment certificate which we call Proceed Realization Certificate (PRC).2. Freelancers should not worry about purpose code on their PRC. I have talked with tax advisors they are just here to make money, they just want to you in making company so they can charge you in different ways. I have talked with FBR they said there is no tax if your income source is remittance which can be proved by PRC. FBR Officer can only ask if they ask but it is rare, the purpose of remittance & you just need to say I'm a freelancer & I provider my service overseas clients. No more no less. PSEB is just for big companies. There is no tax on any remittance you just need to have PRC with any code as proof.3. Some of the freelancers said they get their withdrawals in their local bank accounts as Inter-Bank Funds Transfer in rupees so they try to withdraw in USD just to reflect as remittance this is a little bit expansive & time taking procedure. Upwork & Payoneer both have their partners here in Pakistan just for our convenience so that we can get our funds faster. This is a blessing in disguise. Let me explain to you how:4. More about remittance I would say that it should not be stuck in a branch. I mean If you have an individual bank account & bank holds you remittance just emailcomplaints@pri.gov.pk they will put a heavy penalty on the bank. I don't know the process for business account holders.5. HBL has centralized remittance system I have to go through it to get PRC.

(I'm surprised my ""you were hired"" bar is high because it definitely happens that clients will fade after an interview, or sometimes it turns out the project's not really in my area and I point the client somewhere else).2.

We are considering ways to make My Stats an even more transparent and helpful tool—a tool with insights that show you ways to improve your success on Upwork.I agree with all the comments that there are much more important things to focus on that this page. That said...What's useful on this page are a few of things in the top block: JSS, recommendation rate, long-term client rate. The last updated date would be useful on JSS-update day, if it actually updated at the same time as JSS did. But, it updates hours before the stats change, so it's really meaningless.Recent account holds and TR eligible weeks? I can see how that's useful to someone trying to get to TR, but once someone is TR, there's no need for it to be displayed.Communication section: the number of invites is interesting only for curiosity. A trend graph would make it more useful, but even so, it's not all that important.Marketing effectiveness: this can go. Without more context, it's meaningless. I was viewed slightly less often than people in Writing? Ok, that's fine, but that's a pretty broad category, so I don't know why I should care. But the green bar for interviewed is close to full? How does that make sense with the viewed graph being so low? Without details of how it's calculated, this looks wrong and untrustworthy. And I was hired a bit more often than average? Ok good, but again, it's too broad a category for me to really care.The profile view graph: this can go. There's no information here about what it's counting. I vaguely remember it's related to search, but that's it. And it often goes to 0 for weeks at a time, when I know my profile is getting viewed cause I'm getting invites. It also never agreed with the other discovery graph that I used to get emails about, but I can't find that one at the moment.Profile completeness? Why does this need a progress bar? And how is it related to the discovery graph? It's not, but the placement on the screen makes it look like it is. All this merits is a percentage on the side bar of the profile edit view. That's the only place it's relevant.The more detailed breakdown of stats that Phyllis and Jennifer have suggested would be useful, especially if they came with trend graphs or drilldowns. But I'm really not sure how much I'd pay attention to them. And don't put in comparisons other freelancers, like the current effectiveness graphs. That's meaningless unless it can be narrowed down significantly: academic/technical editors in my price range. I'd really just want to see my raw numbers and a trend.

I don't know how to work hourly based. Can someone explain the process of hourly based projects?,3/14/21 13:52,,53f7d1066faff095,CommunityGuru,"Also, it is very important that you leave a meaningful memo for each time period when you use TimeTracker to book work time.If there is a problem with your client's payment,Upwork will then go through your TimeTracker records to closely review all time segments you have booked throughout the life of the project. This is where it will be vital that your memo for each time you use TimeTracker be clearly written so someone other than you and your client can understand it. For example, your memo might say something like, ""Phone call re calc. def."", which your client might have no problem understanding and would not contest when reviewing your TimeTracker records. But an Upwork investigator who knows nothing about your project might say that wording does not create a sufficient explanation of the work you were doing at that time.In that case, Upwork can disallow the time segment you booked using TimeTracker. You will not be told what has caused Upwork to make this decision nor can you object to it. Upwork will return to itself the payment you received for that work time and you will have no recourse to recoup that lost income.Clear memos are indispensable to assuring full payment under hourly projects.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/I-don-t-know-how-to-work-hourly-based-Can-someone-explain-the/td-p/885084

Even REAL headhunter businesses don't charge such rates.Add to this : cost of 'connects' + tranfer fees + tax and you just break de legs of any small freelancer. In usual language we call that a steal. As freelancers we are not supposed to work for the Upwork stock exchange shareholders, but for our real customers.I don't think of it as Upwork ""stealing"" money from me. I decide how much I want to charge for a project, and then I add 20%. It's impossible to run a business without having any expenses, and people who freelance online probably have fewer expenses than almost any other type of business.As for other headhunters not charging such high rates - I don't know about that, since it's been ages since I've looked for a permanent job, but it's been my experience while subcontracting for various creative agencies that they do take a hefty cut; usually 20-30%, but sometimes as high as 50%. Again, I just charge more to cover their fees, and in return, I get to work for some huge brand names - clients that I would never be able to get on my own. This is a marketing expense that I'm completely happy to pay.It costs a lot of money to advertise a service and bring in clients.

Is Upwork fees 20% TOO high?,11/7/19 4:48,,ad577e66d1c8cd03,CommunityGuru,"Considering that actors' agents average 10%, I do believe that 20% from Upwork is rather costly. An acotor's agent even does a lot of the leg work. What does Upwork do besides acting as an online mediator and securing funds for SOME of the jobs. And now Upwork has the gall to charge the freelancer a bidding fee on top of taking a 20% cut off the top. They say that it is to cut down on the ammount of bids sent out. In my case, there would be substantially less bids being sent out if clients weren't running away due to my rate that has been increased by 20% to compensate for Upwork's greediness. I have no issue with paying Upwork a fair fee as they do provide a great service. However, 20% plus bidding fees has just taken it too far in my humble opinion. And let's face it. The vast majority of contracts are below $500.00 for the type of clientel on the platform.In my line of work there are third party recruiters and they typically charge a third on top of the rate you are presented to the client with. The rate you get for your work is not of your choosing it is whatever is left over with what they negotiate to the client and the their third. Sometimes you can wiggle a few extra bucks per hour out of it and the recruiter gets a little less cheese. They get their cheese for finding you the customer. They actually do a lot more legwork and sell you so they deserve a little more.My example might be just as pointless as yours except for one little thing. On Upwork you can choose your own rate, it is one of the things I very much like about it and one of the things I fear the most that they will mess with. If 20% is too much for you, the charge 20% more, which means you are more likely to get to $500.00 faster, which means even more cheese for you.A wise man with a big, green, bald head once said that mindset is important and I think the mindset people should have is they are running a business and as such they should consider their costs when considering the price of their offering.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Is-Upwork-fees-20-TOO-high/td-p/498225

An acotor's agent even does a lot of the leg work. What does Upwork do besides acting as an online mediator and securing funds for SOME of the jobs. And now Upwork has the gall to charge the freelancer a bidding fee on top of taking a 20% cut off the top. They say that it is to cut down on the ammount of bids sent out. In my case, there would be substantially less bids being sent out if clients weren't running away due to my rate that has been increased by 20% to compensate for Upwork's greediness. I have no issue with paying Upwork a fair fee as they do provide a great service. However, 20% plus bidding fees has just taken it too far in my humble opinion. And let's face it.

A penalty for mindlessly applying to jobs you can't do or don't want. It makes people choose more carefully, and provides clients with a more curated, appropriate list (n.b., despite this, clients often get over 50 proposals per job).Additionally... It limits the thousands of proposals from India, Pakistan, Africa, etc. to a more reasonable number by means of a low financial barrier (so nobody can call Upwork racist or xenophobic).You are welcome to suggest a better solution.

It's a marketing tool that allows clients to easily weed through large numbers of proposals and believe the JSS identifies for them the ""best of the best."", so they can ignore the rest. (Clients have apparently often complained to Upwork when they've gotten large numbers of proposals on their projects, which the JSS and charging freelancers connects for proposals is intended to reduce.)No proof has ever been provided that the JSS predicts how successful a particular freelancer witll be on a particular project for a particular client. But freelancers with ratings above, say, 90 are likely more skilled and easier to work with than freelancers with ratings below, say, 60. However, there is no evidence I have seen that a freelancer with a rating of 92 is worlds better than a freelancer with a JSS of 88.Both should be considered by a client, but many/most clients will likely gravitate to the above 90-rated freelancer, all other things being equal.As far as I know, Upwork provides no guidance to clients as to how they should rate freelancers after a project is complete, so it's a bit of a crapshoot from one client to another when it comes to private feedback, especially with the cagey/dishonest/vindictive/clueless ones.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Reason-for-JSS-decrease/td-p/828191

When projects age out of teh calculation window it can shift the relative weight of remaining projects. Also, last year they made a change and began factoring in the dollar value of projects as a weighting variable, I can't remember the details.

There are many factors that go into the JSS calculation, including both private and public feedback, the weight of the contract, etc. You can check out this help article for more information.To ensure fairness and avoid manipulation, we don’t share the specifics about how we calculate the Job Success Score.We also encourage you to check this announcementwith information about the recent update to the JSS calculation. We are now weighing jobs with higher earnings. If you received less than stellar feedback on one of those jobs, it may have impacted your Job Success Score more.There was also an update in which contracts with no feedback are no longer impacting the score.

Porfolio issues - no image option,3/13/21 19:34,,6176cd09bb5fbddb,ActiveMember,"Hi.

I am a top rated freelancer with 100% rating myself and haven´t needed to apply for jobs in at least two months, so personally Upwork´s connects policy does not affect me much, whichever way it swings.

I don´t know of a real-life situation where a job-seeker or a freelancer is expected to pay money to apply for a job that doesn´t actually exist or that ends up hiring from elsewhere. Since Upwork is a ""pay to play"" platform, if clients don´t hire from the platform while posting ads and attracting paid bids on the platform, Connects should unequivocally be returned.Anyone who runs a business is forced to ""gamble"" all the time. Other kinds of businesses have to take out ads, print posters, spend money on PR - all of these are gambles with no guarantee that it will bring them customers. Even when you search for a job in a traditional way, you need to spend money on transportation and/or parking to go to an interview, with no guarantee that you'll get the job.Placing bids on Upwork is one of the cheapest forms of marketing in existance - even if it doesn't pay off every time - but people still aren't satisfied and expect it to be completely free. (Anyway, connects basically ARE free now, with Upwork handing out 80 connects for answering questions, 10 free connects per month, and 10 more every time you're interviewed.

Should I Report This Client?,3/12/21 16:20,,d324e45037dc32fc,CommunityGuru,I read your post carefully.I see absolutely no reason for you to report this client.You have no control over what other freelancers do.But it is clear that YOUR services are no longer available to this client using a fixed-price contract.,Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Should-I-Report-This-Client/td-p/884527
Should I Report This Client?,3/13/21 4:34,,53f7d1066faff095,CommunityGuru,"Sara J.,Of course a manipulative client is going to pretend that no other freelancers have ever pushed back on being manipulated into doing free work. The pursuit of a high Job Success Score, coupled with intimidation, language differences, etc., etc. makes many freelancers a bit too compliant with unreasonable client demands.This might be one of those cases where you just need to wrap up with this client quickly, but not in a way that upsets the client, and move on. Easier said than done, no doubt.But I hope that in all negotiations with future potential clients you add to your proposal what your work will and will NOT include. Scope creep is the bane of the fixed price project freelancer's experience and the reason I almost never do fixed price projects.And MIkko is right - moving upmarket with clients (and their higher pay rates) who are not extremely budget conscious / cheap will go a long way to avoiding the problems you have faced with this client.Good luck!",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Should-I-Report-This-Client/td-p/884527
Should I Report This Client?,3/13/21 7:42,,acd4bf43e5fcbdab,CommunityGuru,"Please don't waste your and CS time by reporting the client because they have not necessarily committed any violation. The 'asking for free work' transgression typically involves asking for a 'sample' or 'test' work at no cost prior to a contract or, in rarer cases, asking a FL to perform extra work without billing it on an hourly contract. Once a fixed-price contract is in place, determining whether or not specific tasks are covered by the fee is a matter of negotiation. Sometimes a client is intentionally manipulative. Sometimes their expectations are honest. You can't know for sure what other FLs have told them/done for them. You can't rely on cut-and-dried standards or assumptions. Just because you've never had a client request or expect extra tasks doesn't mean other FLs don't happily include them. If I have a good client who pays me well, I'm often happy to do small, extra work to make their life easier and keep them happy. Obviously, that can be a slippery slope but it's all part of client/relationship management. You're in charge. You decide what works for you and then communicate it clearly and stick to it. The ability to have this kind of conversation in a business-like, non-adversarial way is one of the most valuable skills a FL can cultivate. Ultimately, you can't control how the client responds but you can initiate the convo and manage your own demeanor in a way that makes it more likely they'll stay professional, too, even if you ultimately can't agree and decide to part ways.Hope this doesn't sound like a lecture. Just sharing what I've learned (too often, the hard way).",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Should-I-Report-This-Client/td-p/884527

question from clients,6/9/18 20:51,,524f29270c0d464e,CommunityLeader,"I agree with Sheressa! The only time I ever give a client an hour estimate is if I think I can get a job done in an hour. Usually, though, I use days to measure time. For example, a client asked me to track down 250 leads recently, and I told him it'd take a couple of days (if I didn't have any other work those days and could dedicate an entire work day just for this job). Besides that, I can't really give estimates, especially when working in a new program.",Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/question-from-clients/td-p/443497
question from clients,7/11/18 15:18,,55db4eab5750b6bb,ActiveMember,Agreed with both of you. I think the best solution to this is to convince the client to pay you per lead. I usuallydo that and it works best. I think hourly jobs don't work best when it comes to lead generation.,Unedited,Freelancers,https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/question-from-clients/td-p/443497
