There is no option to show your profile to all the clients and hide it for all freelancers.There are three options on UpWork for profile visibility which is:I think the best option for you is to use the Private mode.You can change your Profile Visibility on the UpWork homepage (click on the Find Work link under Find Work on the header navigation). Find for Visibility in the sidebar and edit it.I hope it helps.",

I could look at your profile page and send a copy of it to that individual. Anyone who is a client might also be a freelancer.Upwork is not intended as a tool for hiding information. It is intended as tool for maximizing a freelancer's exposure to potential clients.

            "Aditi J": "Eva, I hear you. I have been in spots where Upwork terms and conditions seemed unhelpful. But it is the freelancer community that helped me to navigate this framework. You are in the right spot. Apart from me, other more experienced freelancers may have suggestions for you too. So please check back periodically.1) Consider adding a video to your profile. When I looked at high earners in your field (e.g. Melissa, or Courtney), adding video seems to be a norm. If you disagree, you might want to change your title. I used your title to do a search and these freelancers showed up.2) Consider adding more portfolio items. These items can be from your assignments on other platforms or sample assignments that you created solely for portfolio purposes. (Although Melissa and Courtney did not have an exhaustive portfolio, several other have 10+ items).3) Consider developing catalog products/pre-packaged products. A potential client can reach you in three different ways- look at your profile and send you a direct message, Or they post a job and you respond to it. Or they look at a catalog product that you have and hire you. At present, you do not have catalog products. Connect with Upwork rep if you need more information about Catalogs. (I myself have not yet developed Catalog products due to technical glitches but I plan to do it during the Spring break.)Hope this helps, I'm rooting for your success.",

It is an entirely valid testimonial, I am just wondering why it may have been declined and how I can have it reviewed?ThanksKeith",
