I see them as a sign of a client not caring enough about his project (otherwise he'd type in his own, specific project-related questions, not click on pre-canned).Definitely. The projects that have vague, one-sentence descriptions and then five canned questions annoy me the most. The client will say something like, \"I need a brochure\" and then say, \"What project have you done that's most like this one, and why?\"Hard pass.",
            "Allyson H": "Yes, I agree these are a sign of them not caring. I have no idea what things look like on their end either I assume when they write the post they have a list of questions they can choose from or they can create their own? I wish we could see what the process is like for a Client, because I have had new people ask me how to do things on here too, which is always weird...I get that they're learning, but there's also the forum, FAQ section, or you can probably contact someone directly.",

            "Phyllis G": "More than once I've responded \"I don't know yet whether or not I'm a good fit but you invited me and I'm interested in learning more.\" Honestly, I couldn't tell you whether it came to anything or not because I almost never give a second thought to an UW bid or an invitation response until/unless I hear back from the client. Most of the ones that use canned questions don't come back, I think, and that's fine with me. I consider them a useful pre-screening tool for me. Clients who are initially clueless can turn out OK but it can also be a sign of laziness.Time spent submitting bids, responding to invitations, tweaking my profile... it's all amortized across the year, it's a cost of doing business. I make a judgement call each time I decide to invest or not invest in pursuing an opportunity. Some days peanuts, some days shells.",
            "Kim F": "\"What project have you done that's most like this one, and why?\"That one irritates me beyond belief. I assume it should be howthat project is similar rather than whyyou did it? If you take it as written,99% of the time the answer is likely to be 'to earn money'. Once in a blue moon, it might be 'because the client was exceptionally good looking,' 'I'm so brill at this and felt like showing off' or some other odd thing. But it's beyond me how such assertions could help anyone. Especially if the client was having an ugly day."
