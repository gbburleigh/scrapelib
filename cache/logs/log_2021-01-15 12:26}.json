You are in the right spot. Apart from me, other more experienced freelancers may have suggestions for you too. So please check back periodically.1) Consider adding a video to your profile. When I looked at high earners in your field (e.g. Melissa, or Courtney), adding video seems to be a norm. If you disagree, you might want to change your title. I used your title to do a search and these freelancers showed up.2) Consider adding more portfolio items. These items can be from your assignments on other platforms or sample assignments that you created solely for portfolio purposes. (Although Melissa and Courtney did not have an exhaustive portfolio, several other have 10+ items).3) Consider developing catalog products/pre-packaged products. A potential client can reach you in three different ways- look at your profile and send you a direct message, Or they post a job and you respond to it. Or they look at a catalog product that you have and hire you. At present, you do not have catalog products. Connect with Upwork rep if you need more information about Catalogs. (I myself have not yet developed Catalog products due to technical glitches but I plan to do it during the Spring break.)Hope this helps, I'm rooting for your success.",

I'm all for women all over the world, however they choose to present themselves, earning their own income. But, the rules of this platform are that you have to show your face in your profile photo. The \"human element\" in online freelancing is an important one for various reasons: the internet is largely impersonal and work is very personal, being able to see the face of the person with whom you are working brings the project from the anonymous internet into the realm of actual work done by actual people, it engenders trust. While your niqab in no way makes you less human, it does cover up a very defining human feature - your face. It's the same reason freelancers are not allowed to use profile photos in which they are wearing sunglasses - they visually obscure the face and serve to conceal identity.I totally understand your point of view and I'm not against it. I would like my customers to build trust in me too of course. But It doesn't make sense to give up one of my beliefs in exchange to that right?Like I said, there are lot of \"more reliable\" methods to verify my identity without having to upload a photo of my face, like verifying my idenity and face with my National ID through customer support or something like that (like I did in other websites) instead of posting a public picture to all people.Thanks for your reply and respecting my way of representing myself.",
