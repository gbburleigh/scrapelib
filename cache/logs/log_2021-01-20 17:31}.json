                "Will L": "George P.As you may know, the process and procedures of arbitration are in some important ways very, very different than what a formal court case would involve. Going to law school may not be an advantage - the lawyer-arbitrators I know have told me many of their fellow lawyers would make terrible arbitrators.If your client is a lawyer and has been an arbitrator himself, he has likely done whatever he could throughout his dealings with you to set up his side of things for success in a potential arbitration.Of course, some lawyers are not as smart as they think they are, so he might be what the English call \"clever\" rather than actually being smart. And the facts of the case in non-legalese might clearly work in your favor - this is what a good arbitrator will sort out for you.But if it's not worth your time and money to go through even a winning arbitration process,you might as well move on.And consider using hourly projects in the future. The client can limit their potential cost by limiting your allowable work time and you are experienced enough to give the client a reasonable expectation of work time required. Hourly clients have no way to force you to use arbitration to resolve their request for a refund, as you've seen can happen with fixed price contracts.Good luck!",
                "George P": "Thank you for the pertinent feedback here, Will.Up until now, I have never been involved with the arbitration process between me and a client here on Upwork for the past 3+ years.I'm sure client has done everything in his abilities toset himself up for success. Even though I think a rational, objective arbitrator would need to perform serious mental gymnastics to see & agree with his point of view.Now, it's definitely not worth my time and money to initiate an arbitration process myself. I over-delivered by measurable metrics and got paid. I would love to just move on, as you suggest, but seems I have no choice if the client decides to escalate into arbitration.Anyways - I do appreciate your advice and I think hourly contracts would provide more security moving forward.All the best!",
                "Tonya P": "Hi there everyone,I've never asked for advice from this community yet, but I've seen plenty of great answers from very knowledgeable people. I hope someone could provide some quality advice, as I truly would appreciate that.I tried not to be too lengthy here, but I also think this issue needs a bit of context.The issue that I currently face:I got contracted for $1,000 to do a Do-It-With-You consulting work package to help an insurance broker and ex. FINRA arbitrator ( the fact that he is an arbitrator is very relevant ) leverage LinkedIn as a platform, and learn to generate leads through a non-paid marketing approach.The job post & scope of work were as follows:**Edited for Community Guidelines**I delivered a 26-page guide + workbook, which also included the flow chart - and a total of 3.5hrs of 1-on-1 screen share video meetings vs. the 1HR agreed upon ( out of my generosity, because I truly believe in going above & beyond for my clients ), to make sure the set-up & consulting work will be concluded successfully.Client was seemingly happy when the work was done, the 2 funded milestones were approved & released at this stage, and I even offered BONUS support for another 14 days + a monthly check-in for the next 90 days to make sure the lead generation system I helped him set-up & coached on will work successfully for him.However, within 48hrs later, I wake up to an open dispute from this client, where he request a full refund because apparently, I have never done my job. He's an ex. FINRA arbitrator himself, and is trying very hard to reach and make his case.BUT not only did I over-deliver ( deliverables required + 3.5X more time than initially agreed upon ) - he's making false accusations ( which by the way blatantly contradict his own job post + our consulting time is video documented and proves his false claims ), he's also wanting to keep me responsible for things completely out of my control - such as a temporary hold on his account with the software tool I recommended ( most likely he did not follow the best practices recommended by me ), or the fact that he doesn't own anything.I DO NOT own that software company I recommended, I do NOT own & control LinkedIn's choices for client's profile either, and most marketing agencies & freelancers have built their entire business on other people's platforms. It was well communicated from the outset, yet he's trying to make his case for a refund with silly points like this.In this case - we couldn't get to an agreement in the mediation phase, and our mediation specialist suggests we escalate to arbitration.I know I'm 100% within the scope of work & I delivered successfully, client seems to have a very 'litigious' attitude & practices lots of legal threats and intimidation tactics - but by no means I want to waste my time & money on an arbitration process where I can still lose money, even if I win, due to the arbitration fees.My question, in this case, is - can I refuse the proposed agreements by our mediation specialist, and then also refuse to participate in the arbitration process? Or am I obligated to participate & pay arbitration fees if we did NOT reach a mutual agreement in the mediation phase?I'm 99.9% sure arbitration would go in my favor - however, I do not want to waste money & time on the process, and have my Upwork account on temporary hold until the issue is being solved - but I also can't let a 'bully' client use intimidation tactics to obtain a refund, in the eventuality of 0.01% he'd win the arbitration just because he used to be a FINRA arbitrator himself and may know the 'ins & outs' of winning cases that are not even favorable to him.I am NOT a lawyer or arbitrator, but I think we've all heard about judicial cases won not on true merit, but on the ability of the lawyers to get what they want. I'm thinking this client is an ex arbitrator and would be very persuasive to make his case - even though it would have to do impossible mental gymnastics in my opinion.Looking forward to hearing your opinions on what options am I looking at, and what course of action would you suggest in this scenario.Thanks a lot!GeorgeOnce mediation is unsuccessful, each party must decide whether they will invest in arbitration or walk away. If the client pays the fee for arbitration and you do not, your Upwork 'career' will be over. So, the question is more--do you wait to see if the client pays for arbitration or put up the money yourself first and see if the client will also?It seems like you over-delivered in an effort to provide good service to a bad client. They have taken your knowledge and now don't wish to pay because you can't make them popular on LI.\ud83d\ude44Look at your writtenor recorded communications. This is what can be most easily proven and defended. Pre-contractual negotiations are what is relevant when it comes to offer and acceptance. What was the actual bargain struck? Evaluate just the facts one by one. What did you promise, what was delivered. After you've done that, you'll be better able to decide whether you want to invest in arbitration."

Something weird happened: the contract has been put on hold for about 12 hours, then it has been reactivated and the milestone with the instructions conflicting with TOS and that were never agreed with me is still there as it was, as nothing happened. The client has created a new misleading job post, same as the previous one that had been cancelled. He is operating as if nothing happened. I therefore reported his message including the illegal instructions for the 2nd milestone.Has something been lost during the process?",

We have a professional marketplace of freelancers and this badge is designed to instill confidence in clients that freelancers here on Upwork are who they say they are. To date, more than 44,000 freelancers have received their ID Verified badge, helping them to build trust with clients.As part of our commitment to maintaining a professional online global freelance marketplace that is safe and fraud-free, we\u2019re requiring every earning freelancer on Upwork to verify their identity to get the badge. This will be rolled out in a phased approach to enable a seamless experience for our freelancers. We will begin requiring the Identity Verified badge for newly earning freelancers in July and start rolling out to existing freelancers starting in August.We\u2019re letting freelancers know now, to give them ample time to review the process and obtain the necessary documents. Those who already have the option to be verified don\u2019t have to wait to complete their verification. They can go ahead and get the badge now by going to User Settings > Identity Verification. Identity Verification process:Freelancers receive the Identity Verification badge after completing a two-part verification process. We\u2019ve improved the process so that freelancers are generally able to complete their verification within 10 minutes, though in some cases it can take up to 1-2 days. To get the badge, eligible freelancers have to successfully pass two stages:Depending on the freelancers\u2019 location and what country they\u2019re from, we ask for the following types of government ID:Access to your information is reserved exclusively for Upwork agents who have passed strict background checks and our third party vendor\u2019s automated checks. Clients can see that you have undergone the verification process from the badge only. What to expectFreelancers will be notified via email and shown an in-product message when they\u2019re required to complete their identity verification. At that time they will have seven days to complete the process, after which they cannot submit proposals and withdraw earnings until they\u2019ve verified. This process will not affect active contracts. Verifying identities is just one part of our efforts to maintain trust within our community. As the landscape evolves, we adapt our methods to stay one step ahead. This also means that we may periodically ask freelancers to reverify their identity to ensure the validity of their accounts.We appreciate all the feedback and issues that have been shared in the forums so that we can quickly improve and implement this process.

                "Lena E": "We are excited to announce that next week we are expanding our location selection features to now include clients in the United Kingdom. Last year, we rolled out a set of location features in the U.S. that allowed clients who are interested in only hiring freelancers within their country the ability to set their freelancer search and job post accordingly. We found that giving clients this additional option brought in more new clients without taking away opportunities from our global community (freelancers\u2019 earnings all over are growing steadily). Because this functionality was well-received by our clients and freelancers in the U.S., we\u2019ve decided to build them out in the U.K. as well. New clients in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), will now be able to post jobs targeted to freelancers in the U.K. Clients in U.K, here\u2019s how it\u2019ll work: U.K. clients who prefer to hire within their country will have the option of setting their freelancer search and job post visibility to freelancers in the U.K. only. And, only freelancers with a U.K. location in their profile will see these jobs and if verified, will be able to submit proposals for them. Clients can always change their mind or choose to invite a freelancer outside of the U.K. to these job posts.Freelancers in U.K., what this means for you:You\u2019ll start seeing jobs with a U.K. location requirementOn your job search, you\u2019ll be able to filter for jobs with this requirement. These jobs will show up in your results, indicated like this:You may be asked to verify your location the first time you submit a proposal for a project with a location requirement. Your city is now displayed on your profile to U.K. clientsOn profiles, your location will now be listed as a city instead of a country. A map will also display pointing to the center of the city. Let us know if you have any questions.",

I am not \"excited!\"I won't outline my feelings about this, as I fail to find polite words.I assume the heavy handed, deliberately and willingly discriminatory practice of making it the default with no true choice will also be included just as it is for US clients?Apparently this is no longer the case, so the above is no longer valid. Thanks for clarifying Valeria! (Maybe best to delete these 4 posts to not confuse others with my outdated outrage  )",
                "Valeria K": "Hi Petra, I suspect your clients were referring to an older version of the job posting flow. The job post flow was updated several months ago when we were updating our site to become mobile friendly. Please, see this thread and screenshots Preston posted of the options shown to US clients.",

                "Joanne Marie P": "Hi Arsalan,If you're referring to location selection for jobs posted, this is currently being offered to US and UK jobs.We recognize that sometimes clients need a freelancer located in the same country. Their projects may require localized knowledge, the possibility of on-site coordination, specific compliance needs, or other factors that make working with someone within their country an easier way to get started on Upwork.We currently support some level of location filtering for all clients by specifying their requirements in the job description and/or setting location as Preferred Qualification, but freelancers from outside the country may still submit proposals.",
                "Gosia B": "HI there!May I ask why I need a British Passport to be able to apply for jobs? The majority of foreigners live in the UK without a British Passport. I've got a Polish passport and the Indefinite Leave to Remain in UK and frankly right now having a British Passport isn't of much use when travelling as quite a few countries hold restrictions on people travelling from the UK, not to mention the ones actually having British passport. The fact that I don't have one shouldn't be a thing disqualifying me from applying for any job/project through your site as I have lived in London for almost 12 years and I have never had the need or the want for a British passport.",
                "Vladimir G": "Hi Gosia,I understand your concern but would like to clarify that you cancomplete the verification processeven if you don'thave a UK passport. Please submit a UK driving licence instead or do follow up here if you don't have a license and we'll assist you further."

                "Lena E": "As noted in our original postwe are making changes to our Terms of Service (TOS) regarding communicating on and outside of Upwork.We understand that not sharing contact information prior to starting a contract is a very real change for how both freelancers and clients use the Upwork platform. Many of you in the Community have shared your concerns in our previous thread which amassed a significant amount of comments burying many of your questions and our replies.We have created this thread to better highlight and answer your specific questions. We are actively exploring opportunities to improve our product features, tools, communications, and education to better meet user needs.UPDATE 6/4/20:On May 26, 2020, we announced upcoming changes to our Terms of Service that will require users to conduct all pre-contract conversations through the Upwork platform.We understand that many of you have questions and concerns about this change, and we want to let you know we have heard you. We also want to clarify the new requirements, which will go into effect on June 26.We know at times it is necessary for a freelancer or client to provide an email address so the other party can gain access to critical systems (for example, an ad analytics account, code repository, etc.). This access allows a freelancer to review a project prior to a contract so they can determine if they have the needed skills, how many hours it will take, etc.Because the Terms of Service changes are about preventing off-platform communication (rather than blocking freelancers from reviewing projects in advance), we are making the following exception:Users may share email addresses for the sole purpose of providing access to a system that contains information about the project. If the system can be accessed without sharing an email address (such as via a link), it should be shared that way.If an email address is provided, it should not be used for any communications, including discussions about the project, until a contract is in place. Off-platform communication creates a risk of scam, fraud, other harmful behaviors, and can lead to circumvention, which is a violation of our Terms of Service.As always, email addresses cannot be requested or shared in a profile, proposal, invite, or job post.For more information, please see:Other helpful articles:",
                "Jay D": "I have asked this on previous threads but must have been missed.Sometimes just a screenshare isn't enough. We need to give/gain access (mouse/keyboard control) to the other person like TemViewer / AnyDesk does, so that we/they can perform some actions on the other device - a use case would be to ask a freelancer to demonstrate that they have understood the process and can operate a private software as required. Having an access would be unavoidable in such case - a screen sharing is not enough!",

                "Steven T": "Yep. I tried to think what I would put in this catalog but couldn't get past the idea that I had to put a price on something that's specific to every project. I was either going to have to price it for the most expensive version possible, a price that nobody would pay, or give some sort of average price and then have people buy the project to do something that should cost more.Like if I offered a browser game, expecting a single screen 2D game and they buy the project and expect a 3D multiplayer persistent universe adventure game for that price. That's a browser game, right?",
                "Valeria K": "Thanks for sharing your experience, Steven. You can consider using pricing tiers to create three different variations of a project based on scope, such as included work, pricing, and time required. Pricing tiers would allow you to create different levels of service for this browser game, showing prices for each so you can set client expectations.You can describe exactly what would be deliveredat each price.",
                "Christine A": "Hi Nicholas and Joshua,But it IS going to force us to change how we work.The project catalogues will take away business from any freelancer who chooses not to use this feature, because fewer clients will post projects for us to bid on.I've decided to try it out because I feel like I have no choice, but I'm pretty sure that it won't work for me; if I have no advantage in being able to craft a tailor-made proposal and address a client's unique needs, then nobody is going to hire me over a cheaper freelancer.What worries me most is that Upwork is actually vetting project catalogue listings and rejecting them for things like images being low quality, or text that contains typos. Meanwhile, profiles in the regular marketplace continue to be auto-accepted no matter how terrible they are. So if clients look at the catalogue and see much higher-quality results as compared to doing a normal invitation-type search, then they're going to lean towards using the project catalogues."

                "Jose M": "I finally see a meaningful attitude. The more proposals you have, the better the chances of the contracers being successful.In my opinion, 10 credits is very LITTLE, in the past they gave 60.Most good jobs require 6 credits, believe it or not you depend on freelancers, even though they are constantly being renewed, that's it and that's it!The more proposal there is, the more percentage of work delivered and the more successful it will be, the higher your commission will be. If you want to increase revenue, bet on advertising for example, but guarantee PF the viability for freelancers, only then will the contracteres (the money men) have reason to use your platform.",

Peanuts, right?So, no need to worry about the price of Connects or how many you get for free.If you know your ideal clients and you also know what makes them tick, all you need is 6 or less Connects to get one project. ;-)",

                "Lena E": "UPDATE: The JSS Metric has been updated to reflect the changes that were announced below. As of today, March 1st, all Job Success Scores are now displaying the updated value. We will soon update JSS metrics to reflect job value in the calculation. Today, a one-week $20 job typically carries the same weight as a one-week $1,000 job in JSS. Soon, JSS will be weighted by job earnings. For example, a one-week $1,000 job will be weighted more than a one-week $20 job. JSS will also exclude contracts with $0 earned and positive feedback. All other JSS policies will remain unchanged.What does this mean?We are making this change so a freelancer\u2019s Job Success Scorewill display a more comprehensive representation of their freelancer work.We understand not all jobs are equal.We know higher budget contracts require more work and freelancers who complete these more complex contracts successfully should get credit for them. Just as longer-term contracts hold more weight in JSS calculations than shorter ones, we believe contract value should also hold significance in the calculation. By giving these jobs more weight, these jobs will have a greater influence on a JSS.Many freelancers will see an increase in their scores if they\u2019ve successfully completed higher budget contracts in the past. At the same time, a small percentage of freelancers may lose their JSS, see a drop in their scores, or lose their Top Rated badge. Today, we are emailing freelancers whose JSS will see a decline of 5% or more, to let them know they will be affected. Freelancers that see a drop in their score can improve their JSS by completing more jobs with positive feedback, as it works today. Larger budget contracts with positive feedback will result in a higher increase in JSS, however, all great feedback contributes to JSS and whether you work on large or small contracts you can still reach 100% JSS.This change will take effect in March, at which time all Job Success Scores will be updated retroactively. We know many of you will have questions about this update. We won\u2019t be able to discuss your individual score or outcomes of specific contracts. We have listed some anticipated questions below, let us know if you have any additional questions.FAQS:Can I know what my new JSS is now before this launches?We will not be able to provide you with your updated score until the JSS calculation refreshes at launch, in March.Does this mean if I don\u2019t get big contracts I\u2019ll never be able to get a JSS of 100%?Receiving stellar feedback on smaller budget jobs can still get you to a JSS of 100%. We are only changing the impact of jobs based on earnings. This means that strong client feedback on a higher-budget job could boost your score more than a lower-budget job. All other aspects of JSS will remain the same.How will I know if it affects me?The majority of freelancers will be affected positively by this change and will see an increase in their scores. We are sending out emails to those who will likely see a drop in their score once the new JSS calculation goes into effect in March.Can this affect me positively, will my JSS go up?Yes! The vast majority of freelancers on the platform will see an increase or very little change in their scores. This is because you may have worked on one or more higher paying contracts in the past, and because you received great feedback that great feedback is being weighted more.Can I lose my JSS?A small percentage of freelancers may lose their JSS. This is because they had one or more jobs with no earnings. Positive feedback on contracts with no earnings will not be factored into JSS once we move to the new calculation. As a result, some freelancers won\u2019t have enough outcomes to be eligible for a JSS until they successfully complete more jobs. Nearly all freelancers have scores after completing eight projects.How does weighting work specifically?To ensure fairness and avoid manipulation, we don\u2019t share the specifics about how we calculate the Job Success Score. Thanks for your understanding.So if I take a bigger job and get negative feedback that counts more than positive feedback on smaller jobs?Yes. A job with higher earnings will always impact your Job Success Score (JSS) more than a smaller job. For example, feedback on a $1,000 job carries more weight on your JSS compared to a $20 job. However, receiving poor feedback on a job with more earnings can be balanced out by doing well on a job of the same size in the future or on a number of smaller jobs.Can I lose my Top Rated badge?Yes, a small percentage of freelancers who see a decline in their JSS may drop below 90% and lose their Top Rated badge. This is because they received less-than-positive public or private feedback on one or more of their higher-paying contracts. Feedback on contracts with higher earnings will affect JSS more after this new change.",
                "Lukas M": "Pretty much all freelancers are very unhappy with the JSS and this step is no improvement. Just look up the JSS article of upwork, 6000+ down votes, 4000 upvotes. Lenghty discussions in forums what the heck is going on with JSS scores. The JSS isnt communicated transparently to freelancers and you are making things worse actually, because by the time people learn how it works, to correct bad JSS now requires huge jobs.What about letting clients fix their private feedback? because private feedback isn't private if it drops your public JSS.This is situation is disappointing for many freelancers.",
                "Michael P": "Jss scores are really awful. Any **Edited for Community Guidelines** can say whatever they want. One client threatened me, another wanted free work. One was a 21 year old who knows nothing. Did you know a person can be sued for a bad review if it harms them. My clients don't need long term relationships with me. The work I do is almost always just once and that's it. I am penalized from that? Odd figuring. I am at 69 percent and have almost given up. The success score really means how much money we can make on you and if you don't make enough, let's just make it miserable to get any work. One of the clients also recently **Edited for Community Guidelines** I met him locally. The beloved clients are **Edited for Community Guidelines**. **Edited for Community Guidelines** were treated nicer.",
                "Yasir K": "Upwork, give all privileges to the client. I wrote to Upwork support that I have proof that my client gave me a review which I didn't deserve but they didn't help me. There should be some mechanism that can check whether the client gives the result on the basis of the work or not. I'm talking about the worst cases. Sometimes Client gives review and ratings on the basis of their mood, which is very harsh.",
                "OLIVIER R": "Upwork forget who is the client >>> It's the freelancer .... 20 %of fees, paid connects for jobs- real or fake, protection ...and they doesn't care their clients. Finally, they will paid the bill... and it will be probably painfull.",

Some clients think that we don't have bills and earning expectancies. But be for more money, harder to get and to retain clients. May upwork bias jobs into more-paying ones, instead of doing it only by the JSS scoring. Or, \u00bf\u00bfisn't that feasible that higheer earnings jobs gets to us??",

I was top rated with 100% SUCCESS RATE, now i suddenly dropped to 85%...WTF?! I mean \"SUCCESS\" should really be ment as SUCCESS!And about fake jobs... There are a lot of fake jobs.

This badge will display on Top Rated freelancers\u2019 profiles after they have gone through the identity verification flow.Many of you have already completed some form of identity verification on Upwork, whether through a video call or by submitting your identity documents. However, clients cannot see this information and are not aware when a freelancer takes steps to verify their identity on Upwork.With this new badge, freelancers now have the ability to proactively verify their identity, and showcase the verification publicly on their profiles. Some Top Rated freelancers may have already verified their identity with Upwork in the past and may see a verified badge on their profile once this feature launches.We will start by rolling this out to Top Rated freelancers over the next few months. When you become eligible, we will notify you when you log in to complete the verification process by going to your Settings and selecting Identity Verification. As part of the verification process you will be asked to upload an official government-issued ID and complete a short video call with us. Once you\u2019ve completed the verification process, the \u201cVerified Identity\u201d check mark will be shown beside your profile photo and name. The badge will display with hover-over text, letting clients know that you\u2019ve verified your identity with Upwork. Although this badge will only be available to Top Rated freelancers for now, we do plan to expand the program in the future and will update you when this is available. As freelancers, you\u2019ve built your reputation on Upwork through feedback, showing a strong work history on your profile, and through the stellar work product you deliver. We\u2019re hoping that this new Identity Verified badge will help you further establish confidence and credibility with clients and better promote your freelance business.

We understood that you are looking for more ways to stand out and want better access to high-value opportunities with quality clients. As we continue to attract more businesses seeking flexible talent solutions, we have also heard their need to more quickly find talent they can trust for complex, strategic, and long-term work. To further our continued efforts towards this vision, we're excited to announce two new talent badges: Top Rated Plus and Expert-Vetted.TOP RATED PLUSWhat is Top Rated Plus?Top Rated Plus is a new status for talent that has a proven track record of excelling on large or long-term contracts on Upwork. On average their contracts last 7 months. These professionals and agencies are highlighted because they have delighted clients on large contracts. Businesses frequently seek talent for large projects or longer-term relationships, and trust talent with this proven experience on Upwork. Right now Top Rated Plus talent has earned more than $100K on average through Upwork, four times as much as Top Rated talent.What are the benefits?What are the requirements to become a Top Rated Plus freelancer?What are the requirements to be Top Rated Plus as an agency?TimingEXPERT-VETTEDWhat is Expert-Vetted Talent?Expert-Vetted Talent is a new status for talent that has deep experience in their field, on or off Upwork.

                "Kelly B": "I have a question, and this issue has been raised before. I have a long term client. More than two years. She hired me for an initial project and left a great review for that, but for the next project she's never been able to leave a review, because she'd have to close out the contract and start a new one to do that, which seems silly and is a waste of her time. Is there any way those kinds of contracts will ever apply?",

                "Sanjay V": "I'm having the same question. However, the client hasn't left any feedback as he's usually busy and we've resumed working again and this time too for the long term. Does this count or would I have to ask him for a review. I wonder if the contract with the same client has started again makes me eligible.Let me know.",
                "Valeria K": "Kelly, Jennifer and Pandora, I'm checking with the team to confirm if a long-term contract needs to be completed and closed in order for it to count toward the Top Rated Plus status or not. I'll get back to you once I have more information about that. UPDATE: Yes, active long-term contracts do count.Also, we have a solution in the works that should address the issue you're bringing up with long-term active contracts that don't receive feedback until they are closed.And... all three of you have the Top Rated Plus badge. We'll be sending out emails to notify freelancers who receive the badge shortly.",
                "Kristin D": "Thanks all for raising this question. It was my understanding a project needed to be closed to receive a referral and rating; since goal is serving client's needs long term this is can work against us in ratings. It would be a good feature fix. I would like to be considered top rated badge as well. Thank you!Warm regards,Kristin",
                "Michael U": "Hi Valeria,I think that what you told us here is not what the support of Upwork understand well.I have a chat with the support agent recently and he told me that the contract need to be closed and feedback received so it can be evaluated for Top Rated Plus badge.Can you clarify here please? I'm attaching my chat with support below:**Edited for Community Guidelines**"

Clients and freelancers will be able to create to-dos, assign an owner, add a short note, and set a due date.We hope the due dates and notes in this tool will be helpful when managing projects and deadlines. You can toggle to view the full list or only tasks assigned to you, so this tool could also function as a way to organize your own tasks for a contract in an easy to access spot.Use the tool however you\u2019d like. It\u2019s completely optional and the deadlines are not monitored by Upwork and do not replace your contract terms agreed upon when starting the contract.You can access the to-do list from your contract workroom.

That way, clients and freelancers won't have to scroll through messages linearlly to find where that comment was from that particular \"to-do\" item from last month, or several months ago.Adding a comment to a \"to-do\" item could post to both the main chat and on the \"to-do\" item to enable a conversation on the \"to-do\" that is also tracked in the main thread (similar to threads in other communication tools).Tim",

                "Mary L": "I really love the new to-do's tab. It's helpful to keep up with login u/p for each client's task assigned to my hourly freelancers. Instead of scrolling through messages, everything is right there. When I say client, I mean my client-- not me as an Upwork client.1) It would be cool to have a \"star\" capability. So, if a freelancer marks a task as complete, s/he still knows where to find the login info for future tasks. Also, if there is a set a branding standards or client-specific protocols, they can be marked with a \"star\".2) Far down the roadmap: I could see how this feature could fold into a team project through \"rooms\" so those grouped together can see what each freelancer is working on.Questions:1) Can the freelancer still see the completed tasks like I can?2) Are the deadlines tracked to their performance? Sometimes I have less urgent tasks that I set for a 48-hour deadline but it's not a critical, hard deadline. I don't want the freelancer to be penalized if s/he goes over a soft deadline per a message that I sent.I notice how the messaging system is more reliable compared to past years. Great job!"

Unfortunately, sometimes we see fraudulent profiles, and to prevent this, on occasion we need to verify the information a freelancer has included in their profile. With this new program, some freelancers may be asked to join a brief video chat with an Upwork representative. During this video call, which should take less than 3 minutes, our representative will ask a few questions to confirm some of the information entered by the freelancer on his/her profile. If you are selected for this test, the request to join a video chat will be sent to you via email. Simply follow the instructions outlined in that message to join our representative for the call.This program is still being tested, so we're not expanding it to all freelancers or clients at this time.

I see a lot of contractors who come to the forum and write their first threads with weird and crazy English sentences. They often have \"English: Excellent\"under their profiles.I know there's tests out there to verify this information, but honestly speaking the tests are not enough because sometimes it's easy to cheat, but if there's a way that an Upwork representativecan SPEAK to them while they're being verified, this gives enough information for Upwork to decide whether their statements are correct or not, and adjust that piece of informationaccordingly.Imagine how amazingly the platform will improveif clients knowin advance that peoplewho bid on their jobs and list excellent English skills in their profiles are really excellent English speakers.Best regards,Wassim",

While I can see some positive results from confirming users' info in this way, I don't expect our team will consider making this improvement in the near future, for a number of factors that come into play when testing a specific skill.

May I suggest you also check out this thread and consider imposing more serious sanctions (such aswithholding payments) to freelancers that create fake profiles and/or state fake credentials.

                "Blake M": " Ro, Withholding payment, without the recipients consent, of wages for services performed is a very BAD idea. This could, and probably would, violate local, state and federal wage laws. Failing to pay these wages is a crime known as wage theft and I would be shocked if Upwork actually engaged in such activity. A lot of states allow employees who have not been paid the wages they are due to file wage claim complaints with state work commision(s) who can then, at their discretion, begin serious investigations. No this would not be a good idea. Some other method really needs to be considered. Blake M.",

                "Mohammad A": "New rule of withholding TDS for indians is going to start from Oct.1.So now freelancer earning will be like 20% upwork commission, 0.75% TDS, $1.5/10 connects, $0.99 per withdrawal to local bank, this is so ufair upwork should reduce the commission fee they have imposed, or should provide free monthly connects.",
                "Biju J": "It is totally unfair charging TDS on the amount upwork takes as service charge.TDS should be charged only on the amount the contractor receive. That is our earing.",

                "Isabelle Anne A": "The dead hand of the tax man.Yeah. This plus the 10%-20% fees, fees for membership, withdrawals, etc. It's just charges on top of more charges.",
                "Harsh P": "Take everything whatever we are earning... 20% Fees!Paid Connects to send Proposals!Withdrawal Fees!and now TDS withholds!Seems like in near future only paid membership to create an account on Upwork!!",

Regarding, the tax announced here, we are required to forward any tax we collect from our users to the Indian government.",
                "Shivranjan K": "Then upwork must decrease service fee from 20% to 10%. It's so unfair if this continues people will surely look at a different platform.",
                "Bojan S": "HiShivranjan,Freelancers are charged a sliding fee based on their lifetime billings with each client (across all contracts they've ever had with that client's company). Once they have earned $500 with one client their fee will be reduced to 10%. To learn more about our freelancer's fees check out this guide.Thank you!"

                "Lena E": "We have expanded Direct Contracts to support hourly jobs. As previously announced, Direct Contracts allow freelancers to invoice and manage contracts on the Upwork platform without their clients having to create an Upwork account. This was previously only available for fixed-price contracts and with this expansion, freelancers will now be able to generate contracts that require an hourly breakdown of their work on a recurring basis. Direct Contracts make it easy to manage and collect payment from non-Upwork clients. Clients won\u2019t have to create an Upwork account or pay any additional fees. All of the contract management and payment is sent to the client via email, keeping the experience easy for them to use. And with Upwork Escrow and dispute assistance, freelancers can work confidently with their clients who are not on Upwork.Here\u2019s how it works for hourly:Freelancers can create a Direct Contract through their Upwork account from the main navigation bar, by clicking on the paper airplane icon (beside the bell). Setting up a Direct Hourly Contract takes 3 easy steps. The freelancer will enter the contract details, their hourly rate and the total number of hours they\u2019ll per week, review the contract, and send.Once they\u2019ve created a contract, the client will receive an email with the contract details to approve. The client will also be required to deposit funds before the contract starts. This way freelancers can be assured in knowing they have payment protection, as the funds are already secured before they begin the contract. The amount required is based on one week\u2019s work total, which is calculated by multiplying the hourly rate and the estimated max hours. Once the contract has been accepted and funds deposited, freelancers will see the prompt for them to begin logging hours. With Direct Hourly Contracts, there is no Time Tracker, hours are logged manually each week and must be entered by Sunday of that workweek.Monday, following the completion of the previous work week, opens the review period for clients. Clients will be able to review and approve the logged hours until Friday. On Friday, freelancers are paid for the previous week\u2019s work that has been approved by the client. This timeframe is the same as Upwork\u2019s faster payout option, which allows freelancers to receive funds five days earlier than marketplace jobs. This is because we are eliminating the security hold on these payments. You can learn more about Direct Contracts here. You can also find more details in the FAQs we provided below.How is my payment for hourly work protected with Direct Contracts?After you and your client agree to create a contract and set a weekly rate and time limit, we\u2019ll estimate the weekly total and require your client to deposit that amount into Upwork\u2019s secure escrow account. Once your client funds the deposit, we will notify you and you can confidently begin work knowing your payment is secure. Note: Payment protection does not cover additional work hours beyond the set weekly limit or expenses.How does Upwork calculate the security deposit and weekly charge to the client?We calculate the security deposit by simply multiplying your rate against the weekly limit that has been set by you and your client. For example, if your rate is $10/hr and your weekly limit is set to 40 hours, we will set the deposit as $400 (or $10/hr x 40 hours). The weekly charge is determined after the work week. We set the weekly charge based on how many hours were invoiced in the previous week.When does my client get charged each week?We will charge your client for the previous week each Monday.When do I get paid for my work?Once your hours have been submitted for invoice, payment will be reflected in your Upwork balance the following Friday as long as your client doesn\u2019t dispute the hours. ",
                "Alexander B": "I usually use hourly contracts in place of the fixed price contracts because I like the protection offered with hourly contracts.So for example, a client will hire me (my hourly rate being $90/hr) to write an email for $125. I will bill them, roughly, for about 1 hour and 25 minutes, whatever it takes to reach $125 when you're working at $90/hr. Even though the weekly limit is 40 hours, or 10 hours, I'm not going to bill them that much.Is it possible that the freelancer can set the amount the client should fund in escrow? I imaigne this would be pretty easy to implement.",
                "Joanne Marie P": "Hi Alexander,For Direct Contracts, the freelancer sets up the weekly limit before sending the contract to the client. To start, we calculate the deposit by simply multiplying your rate against the weekly limit that has been set. For example, if your rate is $10/hr and your weekly limit is set to 40 hours, we will set the deposit as $400 (or $10/hr x 40 hours). After the first week, the weekly charge depends on how many hours were invoiced in the previous week. Thanks for your feedback. I'll be sure to share it with the rest of the team.",
                "Russell T": "That is the way I have been encouraging Upwork to escrow out typical standard hourly Upwork contracts..(as non-payment/lack of funds have been on the rise lately).any plans on moving that system over the the normal UpWork side?",

                "Nikola S": "HiHarriet,Thanks for your question. The Time Tracker feature is not an option with Direct Contracts. With hourly Direct Contracts, you and the client agree to a weekly limit on hours. Before releasing payment, the client can also review the manual hours invoice so they can reach out to the freelancer with any questions and, if needed, file a dispute.Regarding your second question. To start, we calculate the deposit by simply multiplying your rate against the weekly limit that has been set. For example, if your rate is $10/hr and your weekly limit is set to 40 hours, we will set the deposit as $400 (or $10/hr x 40 hours). After the first week, the weekly charge depends on how many hours were invoiced in the previous week.Let us know if you have further questions."

In January, we announced our plans to highlight top talent and welcomed your feedback. Last month we announced two new talent badges, Top Rated Plus and Expert-Vetted. Continuing on this path we are excited to share our new Upwork Skills Certifications.We have launched a new initiative to help freelancers showcase their expertise by earning an Upwork Skill Certification. These skill certifications highlight talent that has demonstrated competency in their field by passing a rigorous skill assessment or sample work review, evaluated by domain experts in their field.Currently, Upwork Skill Certifications are available for certain skills in the Web & Mobile Software Development (WMSD) and Design & Creative fields. For WMSD, certification is a two-step process that takes 2 to 3 hours. Participants must achieve a passing score on two timed and proctored coding tests. Design & Creative talent must achieve a passing score on their Upwork portfolio, which is evaluated by a panel of third-party domain experts. You can learn more about Upwork Skill Certifications here. Given the intricacy of having skills assessed, these certifications are exclusively invite-only at this time.Upwork Skill Certifications will display on your Upwork profile in the certifications area.Here is an example of a Microsoft certification on a profile. Upwork Skills Certifications will appear in a similar format but with an Upwork badge for the specialized certification.Upwork Skill Certifications are currently available in 10 software development languages and 16 design and creative skills.Upwork Skill Certifications in Web & Mobile Software Development test for individual proficiency in a particular language or technology. Assessment methodology varies by skill, using a combination of timed, proctored tests and in some cases, technical interviews.Upwork Skill Certifications in Design & Creative test for an individual\u2019s or agency\u2019s demonstrated competency in current design best practices. A panel of 2 or more domain experts evaluates a freelancer or agency Upwork portfolio based upon several dimensions depending upon the skill.We plan to grow the program and offer the skill assessments to more talent and in additional skill areas. You do not need to have earned a talent tier such as Top Rated or Expert-Vetted to receive an invitation. These are signals of having expertise in your field and do increase your chances of being invited, though. For the best chance of being invited, achieve and maintain a solid reputation, complete identity verification, maintain a complete and up-to-date profile that is not set to private, and have an active Upwork account in good standing.",

Starting today, freelancers from all categories will gradually begin to see the option to create a specialized profile. As we roll this out to all freelancers over the next couple of weeks, freelancers will see a pop-up when they login that will notify them of this feature and of how to complete their specialized profile. As you may recall in our announcement last year, specialized profiles give freelancers the ability to market and highlight their expertise in specific skill sets through separate profiles for each skill. For example, a freelancer may work as a graphic designer and also a web developer, but it can be complicated to make one profile highlight completely different skills. With specialized profiles, freelancers can create tailored profiles with specific overviews, relevant work histories, and portfolio items to showcase their experience. They can also market themselves at a rate applicable for that specific skill. The specialized profiles appear as tabs on the general profile page.For more information on specialized profiles, check out this video with Zak, a product manager at Upwork.*Update 11/25:We\u2019ve recently added a couple of new settings to Specialized profiles. You\u2019ll be able to access them under Settings> Profile Settings or simply by clicking Manage Specialized Profiles link on your Find Work> Profile page.Change Order of Specialized profiles:You\u2019ll be able to change the order in which Specialized profiles show on your profile by clicking on the icon in the right upper corner of the Specialized profiles box.Change Specialty:You\u2019ll also see a Switch Specialty option for each Specialized profile. That will allow you to change the Specialty of a Specialized profile.Please, see the screenshot below for more information:Update 12/19: Now freelancers who are creating Specialized Profiles or editing an existing Specialized Profile will be able to add skills in an \"Other Skills\" field. They won't be limited only by the skills related to that Specialty.",

With this new release, we have also expanded the functionality to now include multiple milestones.Direct Contracts allows you to enter into fixed-price contracts with non-Upwork clients, offering access to Upwork's safety and security features with greater flexibility for your business. Freelancers can access their Direct Contracts by clicking on the new paper airplane icon next to notifications or directly here.Here\u2019s how it works:On the Direct Contracts page, freelancers will see the option to start a new Direct Contract and a list of all existing Direct Contracts along with the status of that contract. The steps to start a new Direct Contract are very simple:1.Enter your client\u2019s details2.Add either a single amount or create milestones with each amount3.Review and send the contract4.An email is sent to your client to beginYour client will receive an email notifying them of your detailed proposal, along with some guidance on how the product works.Just like your other fixed-price contracts on Upwork, your client deposits project funds in escrow before the contract starts. You will see the status of the milestone listed below each one, so you will know when to begin working. When you\u2019ve completed the contract or each milestone, you\u2019ll request payment from your client. And with Direct Contracts, once they\u2019ve accepted your request, the funds are released to you immediately, with no security period.As a freelancer, you\u2019ll pay a processing fee of 3.4% of the total contract amount, but you won\u2019t pay any freelancer service fees to Upwork. It\u2019s easy for your clients because they won\u2019t have to create an Upwork account or pay any additional fees. And with payment protection and dispute assistance, you can work confidently with your clients who are not on Upwork.Let us know if you have any questions.",

This post aims to provide transparency into the changes and answer any questions you might have.On November 8th, 2020, we updated the JSS calculation process to exclude contracts that ended without feedback. Before, if a freelancer or agency had a large number of contracts that ended without feedback, those contracts could have negatively impacted their JSS.What is JSS?Your JSS measures and reflects your Upwork clients\u2019 satisfaction with the projects you complete for them. You can view your score on your My Stats page and learn more about JSS here.What does this mean?We removed projects where clients didn't leave feedback from consideration in the JSS calculation in November. This means that it will no longer negatively impact your JSS if a client does not leave feedback at the end of a project. Note that, as a result of this change, a small set of professionals no longer had enough outcomes with different clients to earn a JSS. To minimize this impact, we reduced the minimum number of distinct clients required to earn a JSS from 3 to 2.What\u2019s the problem with including contracts that end without feedback in the JSS calculation?Picture a contract where a professional and a client work together, and at the end of it, the client does not leave feedback. Before the change, if the professional already had a high percentage of completed contracts without feedback, the professional\u2019s JSS could have been negatively affected.The original design was based on a study that found clients who had negative experiences would often avoid filling out the feedback form altogether instead of giving negative reviews. More recent analysis suggests this may no longer be true. As a result, we are changing the calculation to reflect today\u2019s reality.How does this change affect you?What\u2019s next?This is just one of several changes we\u2019re planning to implement in the coming months, so stay tuned!This post itself is in response to your feedback that you want to be informed when changes are made. Thanks to everyone who has offered feedback on JSS communication through our customer surveys and social media, through the Upwork Community, and directly to our team. Be on the lookout for more changes to JSS and other aspects of the Upwork experience in the near future.We are all looking forward to this next chapter together!",

Check your emails from U ...Many kudos to Upwork, and in particular Lena, for conveying long-term freelancer reasoning behind the reasons for this change.

But i definitly agree that fixed price/flat rate contracts should only be approved when the client deposit the first milestone. In my view that would help to keep part of the freelancers profit, it will assure that Upwork will keep their fee, and would also keep way freeloaders looking for free work.",

I work from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but I deal with my life throughout the day as well. Also, I personally like to do as much research as I want for a project, and not worry about billable hours because I got into an article while the tracker app was turned on. Give me a job, I'll do it, and do it well. Pay me for the job, and I'm good.The only time I've needed a milestone was when the relationship with a client just wasn't working. I suggested she pay me a milestone for the work we had done to that point and go our separate ways, which we did. That parting was amicable, but it still reflects negatively to anyone that uses that score to judge me."

These dial-in numbers will be helpful for users with internet connectivity issues or other issues that prevent them from making calls from the platform, by giving them an option to use their phones.How it works:To keep your information private, the user's phone number will not be shown to the call participants.The feature is available for all Upwork users. Numbers are available from the following countries.The current list of countries as of today are: USA, Finland, Netherlands, Kenya, Canada, Cayman Islands, Iceland, UK, Indonesia, Philippines, Czech Republic, Serbia, Belgium, Thailand, Israel, Uganda, Puerto Rico,Hong Kong, New Zealand, Columbia, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Singapore.If your country is not on the list, you can still use other numbers from the list.",

How does it work if one person needs to dial in and the other use their computer? For example, if a client calls me from their computer, but I have to dial in, will the call just hang up for them if it takes me more than 10 seconds to dial in? Will I need to dial in and then tell them to call back?Also, will this dial-in feature allow multiple people on the call?",
                "David S M": "I had a call scheduled with a client (the dial-in call through Upwork messages...the one in messages when you click on the phone icon and drop down to \"Phone call\", yeah that one). Anyway, I decided to use this with the client because the \"Upwork call\" doesn't work on my computer...audio and video does not work. And, why would I ever want to troubleshoot that while on a live call with a real client. That seems to be the only way to make an Upwork call, is with a real client. So we have the phone call scheduled and naturally the client and I both had issues (room not found the recorded voice said). Evidently, Upwork changes the phone call VIN number often...unsure how often...then neither of us could get a new number and PIN...just a scrambled greyed-out screen....I apologized to the client for the issues and asked if we could reschedule, we did, and the client was a no show, as I suspected. They must have gotten fed up with Upwork's bugs and ran! Thanks for driving your clients away, Upwork, that's special. I guess Upwork giveth and Upwork taketh away. But what about my time that's been wasted. And what do I do now going forward. I contacted Upwork support to help me fix the issues I'm having with both Upwork Call and Phone call. It's been 3 days since I first asked for help and, with the one exception of me figuring out a way to workaround the phone call greyed-out screen bug on my own, still neither Upwork Call or Phone call are fixed.",
                "Valeria K": "Hi David,I'm sorry to hear you've had a negative experience using the Dial-in option. I'm going to check on your ticket and follow up with the team regarding the status of the issue. We'll provide an update as soon as possible.Update: I discussed it with our engineers and they confirmed that this issue is already being addressed. Currently, you should be able to test if it works using the incognito window of your browser:- Open incognito mode in Chrome (as an example) - Select any room with 1 participant- Click on the call icon on the top right and select \"phone call\"- You will be able to see whether the page opens in incognito window",

                "Lena E": "We are releasing a new feature that introduces mid-job feedback into contracts. Clients will soon be able to leave public feedback for freelancers while a contract is ongoing. This feedback helps freelancers share the progress of a job and have it reflected in their work history before a contract has ended.Why we made this change:Gathering feedback on a contract only when the contract ends leads to a delay in gathering feedback on longer-term contracts. We hear from our customers that contracts are being closed for the sole purpose of providing feedback. Freelancers want feedback reflected in their work history and request clients to end contracts to provide feedback. This desire for feedback has led to unnecessary closure of contracts, and we would like to address the issue by facilitating optional public feedback throughout the contract (rather than only at the end of the contract). We also believe that multiple public feedback touchpoints will better communicate the progress of long-term ongoing contracts and reduce the number of contracts that close with no public feedback. We're also considering how we can incorporate mid-contract feedback into Job Success Scores (JSS), but for now, this feedback will not factor into your JSS.How it works:Public feedback (not private feedback) will be able to be provided from the client to the freelancer without ending a contract. Assuming the eligibility criteria noted below are met, a client will proactively be able to provide this feedback, OR a freelancer will be able to request feedback from the client. When a freelancer requests feedback, clients will have 14 days to provide the feedback.If feedback is not provided within this timeframe, the request expires, and a freelancer can submit another request assuming the eligibility criteria continue to be met. (We\u2019re gradually rolling feedback requests out to freelancers. All clients will have the option to leave mid-job feedback, but only select freelancers will see the request feedback button at this time.)Eligibility Criteria: Feedback can be requested by the freelancer or provided by the client if the following criteria are met:Here are details about the new experience from both freelancer and client views. Only public feedback is gathered from the client as part of this mid-contract feedback flow. When feedback is provided, it will be shown in a freelancer\u2019s work history. There are no impacts to JSS since mid-job feedback does not impact JSS.NEW FEEDBACK TAB:All feedback provided on a given contract (mid-contract and end-of-contract feedback) will be shown in a new Feedback tab of the Contract Room for both clients and freelancers.Feedback will also be displayed in freelancers\u2019 work history under the active contract.The new flow is detailed belowFreelancer View (currently only select freelancers): If eligibility criteria are met, freelancers have a \u201cRequest Feedback\u201d option in the new Feedback tab of the Contract Room.Client View: Clicking \u201cRequest Feedback\u201d triggers an email and Dash message to the client with a request for feedback.Client View: Clients fill out this form to provide mid-contract feedback. The form includes only public feedback and not private feedback.Client View: Alternatively, when eligibility criteria is met, clients can choose to proactively provide feedback by clicking the \u201cGive Feedback\u201d button in the Feedback tab or in the overflow menu of the Contract Room. Clicking this",
                "David M": "Thank you for listening Upwork - this is a brilliant idea.Please communicate it properly to the clients though.Could you include in your messaging a reminder about the concept of milestones?There are many clients who frequently post new jobs but hire the same freelancer repeatedly.This results in wasted time (and connects) in unsuccessful job applications.If that same client simply created a new milestone each time they had another job for their current preferred freelancer, it would benefit everyone concerned (except Upwork due to loss of connect income). With this new solution allowing for jobs to stay open longer, this could work, however there needs to be some impact into the JSS.One question: You stated this: We hear from our customers that contracts are being closed for the sole purpose of providing feedback The reason freelancers wanted the feedback so desperately was because of the messy and secretive JSS calculations. I'm sure if you did a poll amongst freelancers asking them how feedback or JSS works the results would be all over the place. Failure to implement this change without it actually affecting the JSS is not only a waste of time but an irritation to clients. Are the rules for this mid-job feedback going to be the same as the post-job feedback - i.e. will freelancers and clients still have the ability (based on their earnings/status/tier badge they've earned) to delete the public feedback which everyone needs to see to make an informed decision?I find it bizarre that the ability to hide public feedback even exists - what is the actual point of the system especially with so many clients offering guaranteed 5 star feedback for low paying jobs?Another issue which desperately needs fixing, is being able to see feedback sorted by rating (not simply highest or lowest). The reason I say this is for any profile (client or freelancer) with many jobs, to find the last job they were badly rated on is extremely tedious - sometimes 40 pages of feedback need to be scrolled through, clicking next, next, next ad-nauseum, only to find something poorly rated (less than 5 stars) but then the actual PUBLIC feedback has been hidden! How is this user friendly? Please fix it! Look at Amazon for an example - you can easily choose to see the 1 star or the 2 star or the 5 star with a single click. Surely it can't be that hard to implement? Employ someone on the platform and get it done at a 20% discount.I realize you're simply the messenger, so before too many more questions get posted which you don't have the answers to, could the brains behind this new feature please introduce themselves and get some public feedback from both clients and freelancers to assist with yet another weird \"beta\" testing live-software-release-without-telling-anyone-until-it's-too-late which it seems Upwork is growing rather accustomed to of late.Maybe you could come up with surveys which could be sent to those freelancers with the new uber badge and actually pay them for their advice (in real money, connects, kudos, a coffee mug, or even just a thank you) to take part in the continuous changes you're so intent on implementing.Why we made this change:Gathering feedback on a contract only when the contract ends leads to a delay in gathering feedback on longer-term contracts. We hear from our customers that contracts are being closed for the sole purpose of providing feedback. Freelancers want feedback reflected in their work history and request clients to end contracts to provide feedback.

                "Lucio Ricardo M": "I see other drawback. There are clients that want jobs with milestones for $50 but that it ends up lasting 4 days. then, if they catch you in a bad day, they could punish you with feedback.",
                "Eve L": "Will this kind of feedback count towards the requirement to have at least one positive feedback on a large contract within the last 12 months to maintain or get the TR+ badge?",
                "Vladimir G": "Hi Eve,Thanks for the question. In short, no. With mid-contract feedback, we want to provide the opportunity to share feedback without having to end a contract.To clarify the Top Rated Plus requirement you mentioned, it's actually at least one large project in the last 12 months without negative feedback.",
                "Shahinur A": "my client is unable to write feedback. He wrote to me \"I'm sorry I wasn't able to send my feedback because upwork will only let me do that when it's a 30-day contract.\" whats the solution ?",
                "Aleksandar D": "Hi Shahinur,In order to leave a Mid-Job Feedback, 30 days need to pass since the start of the contract. If there is no more work to be done on the contract you are referring to, you can ask your client to end the contract and leave the feedback that way.Thank you.",
                "Jamiu I": "We hear from our customers that contracts are being closed for the sole purpose of providing feedback. Freelancers want feedback reflected in their work history and request clients to end contracts to provide feedback. This change doesn't really make any difference for the freelancer if the feedback doesn't count towards the JSS.If a potential client sees an ongoing job, there is a sense in which they believe that the contract is going on well at the moment. So, what's the essence of getting feedback for an ongoing contract if the feedback will have no effect on JSS?I think you should conduct another research to know the real reasons why freelancers will want to have a mid-contract feedback. Compare reasons like: (1) to have it count towards JSS (2) to have it listed in Work history etc. That should help in knowing the most important reason which this new change should seek to address.",
                "Mary W": "I can see this going very wrong. Contracts can get screwed up = bad mid term feedback. Client and freelancer get on same page = great final feedback. I can also see the blackmail clients drooling over this option. Bless their hearts.",

Today, we are happy to announce that all Top Rated freelancers and agencies working on hourly contracts are eligible to receive their funds five days earlier. This is because we are eliminating the security hold on their payouts.For Top Rated agencies and freelancers, the earnings for hours that you worked last week will be available to manually withdraw this Friday. You will see a notification under your bell icon and receive an email about the updated payment schedule for your hourly contracts for this week.Because this is for Top Rated agencies and freelancers, the early release of funds will depend on when you currently have the Top Rated badge. If you lose or earn the Top Rated status during this time, your payment schedule will be adjusted to include or exclude the security hold.How does it work?As long as your client\u2019s billing method can be charged successfully and they don\u2019t dispute your hours, we will apply their payment to your Upwork account five days earlier than before if you are Top Rated. You can then withdraw the money anytime you prefer by clicking here and choosing \u201cGet Paid Now.\u201d Note: If you have an automatic payment schedule set up, this will not adjust the schedule, so if you want your earnings sooner, you also can use \u201cGet Paid Now.\u201dWhy are we only rolling this out to Top Rated freelancers and agencies?We know that many of the talent on Upwork would benefit from receiving their earnings faster. However, during these unprecedented times, changing our policies also creates a higher risk of fraud. Due to the potential risk, we are initially rolling this out to the marketplace\u2019s most successful freelancers and agencies\u2014those who are Top Rated. In the future, we will consider expanding this to other freelancers.Why do we have a 10-day wait in the first place?There is an inherent risk in payment processing, driven by the potential of fraudulent people, disputes, and chargebacks. We also need to give clients time to review their freelancer\u2019s billed hours and project progress before payment is released. But in these unusual times, we understand how important it is for you to get payouts as quickly as possible. As a result, we are willing to take on additional risk and remove the security-hold period for Top Rated freelancers and agencies so you can get your money five days sooner.Will this be available only during COVID-19?While we plan to continue the practice after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, we will be monitoring the impacts of this change.Why is this only available for earnings on hourly contracts and not fixed-price contracts?With faster payments we decided to focus on the removal of security holds from hourly contracts first because the majority of contracts on Upwork are hourly. We understand faster payments will be a benefit for all contract types and we plan to explore making fixed-price payments faster in the future.Upwork is dedicated to our community, and all of our teams are focused on keeping independent professionals working.

                "Jennifer M": "Hi Lena,Does this mean that clients can no longer request all money back on the contract by funding a new milestone? It sounds to me that they can't dispute after a milestone has been released for over 30 days, but what if it's been 45 days (for instance) after milestone 1 has been released, but the client funds a new milestone B. Can they now request dispute of the entire amount or only milestone B?",
                "Jennifer S": "Hi Jennifer,Great question. A client can request a refund on paid funds at any time, however it is up to you as the freelancer to authorize it. Filing a dispute does not mean paid funds will be automatically refunded. Technically speaking, if there are funds held in Escrow, the entire contract would be eligible for Dispute Assistance, which includes the option of Arbitration. The goal of Dispute Assistance would be to reach a mutual agreement between both parties. If an agreement cannot be reached, the contract could proceed to Arbitration in which a legal ruling would determine what happens to both the funds held in Escrow and previously paid.However, I think I understand what you are asking. Can a client fund a new milestone in an attempt to get a refund on past paid funds? While yes, funding a milestone makes the entire contract eligible for Dispute Assistance, we also have systems in place to identify abuse of the Dispute Assistance program. This scenario is rare and one that is usually very obvious and would be handled appropriately on an individual basis.Delayed milestones or additional work needed after 30 days from releasing the first milestone, happen all the time. The functionality of Escrow allows long term jobs to proceed at the cadence required for the specific project.",
                "Tarpinder S": "6.2 DISPUTE OF FUNDS RELEASED Section A: Dispute Mediation Deadline: Dispute Mediation must be initiated within 30 calendar days of the date that funds in Escrow have been released from Escrow to the Freelancer in order to be eligible for the Dispute Assistance Program under this Section 6.2. Any dispute over funds that have been releasedfrom Escrow more than 30 calendar days prior to the date the dispute is filed is no longer eligible for submission to the Dispute Assistance Program.Then why this, the above clearly statesany dispute over funds that have been releasedfrom Escrow more than 30 calendar days prior to the date the dispute is filed is no longer eligible for submission to the Dispute Assistance Program.",

Another reason I only work hourly. I just keep accumulating reasons for avoiding escrow at this point.Why Upwork doesn't write the TOS so that we can understand them?And no longer because of the language (something very important), but because I am sure that even many English speakers cannot understand what is being said.I do not understand anything, and specifically the points about disputes, mediations, etc ...",

We will be notifying all active freelancers with a PayPal withdrawal method through email and with an alert bar on your \u201cGet Paid\u201d page.To get started, you will need to reactivate your current PayPal account. You can do this by clicking the link to connect your PayPal from the alert bar or email. Alternatively, you can click the \u201creactivate\u201d link displayed on your PayPal payment method on the Get Paid page. Note that when completing this connection to PayPal there is a 3-day security hold.Follow the steps below for guidance on how:1. Click reactivate under your current PayPal account or click \"connect your PayPal account to Upwork\" in the alert message shown on your \"Get Paid\" page.2. To Connect your PayPal to Upwork you will be prompted to re-add your PayPal account, click continue.3. You will then be prompted to re-add your PayPal by clicking Set Up4. This will redirect you to the PayPal login where you will then securely connect your PayPal account to Upwork.5.

We heard some great feedback from users here in the forums and through other communication channels. You told us that although this was a good idea, you would rather propose a new contract on the Upwork site instead of through an email link as we were providing. You also wanted freelancers to have the ability to create a contract for hourly or fixed-price projects, which clients could simply review and approve. We thought this would be a good idea too, and would perhaps reduce the friction that we sometimes hear from clients and freelancers when trying to rehire for another job. So, in the coming weeks we\u2019ll be releasing a new feature that gives freelancers the ability to propose a new contract with an existing client, straight from the My Jobs page. Freelancers, once you\u2019ve discussed further opportunities and projects with your client and have agreed on starting a new contract, you can send them a proposed contract by clicking the \u201cPropose New Contract\u201d button from a contract in your My Jobs or All Contracts pages. The contract form allows freelancers to set up the contract as hourly or fixed price with proposed milestones. Clients can then simply accept, decline or edit the proposal which will then send an offer back to the freelancer.Thanks for your feedback, we hope you enjoy this new feature. Let us know if you have any questions. ",

I have found that after messaging with people in order to learn more about their project needs that the next step is to propose the terms of a contract. Being able to immediately propose contract terms to them in a way that they can easily accept would be a great additional feature.Thanks."

                "Lena E": "Starting March 1st, Upwork will begin charging VAT on our fees to freelancers and agencies in Belarus. A Value Added Tax law was introduced in Belarus which applies to fees charged for electronic services from non-Belarusian businesses (like Upwork) to Belarusian consumers.If you are a freelancer or agency on Upwork who is operating as a separate legal entity in Belarus, Upwork will not charge you VAT. To confirm whether or not you are a legal entity, we will begin asking freelancers and agencies in Belarus to enter their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). We will be notifying all freelancers and agencies in Belarus via email. You will also see a notification when logging in.Here\u2019s a simple example of how it would work, assuming the a 20% Upwork service fee:Your contract amount$100.00Upwork service fee (including VAT)Upwork\u2019s service fee is $100 x 20% = $20 E-services VAT to be paid to the Belarus government by Upwork is $20 x 20% = $4Total fees including VAT is $20 + $4 = $24 -$24.00Take-home earnings after service fees and VAT$76.00In other words, considering the example above, the user will only be charged VAT on the $20 freelancer service fee, so 20% of $20 means they will be charged $4 for VAT. These amounts will appear on invoices and in your Transaction History and will be calculated in U.S. Dollars.If you have questions regarding your tax obligations, please consult your tax advisor. For more information on Upwork charging VAT, see this help article. For more information on VAT laws in Belarus, see here. Let us know if you have any additional questions. ",

I have seen already deductions from my account.The Tax Law in Belarus is called \u201cVAT by foreign companies supplyingcross-borderonline services to private consumers in the Republic of Belarus\u201d. The foreign company is UpWork. Not me. Why the freelancers need to pay this tax? So, the correct example need to be:Contract amount - $100.00Upwork\u2019s service fee is $100 x 20% = $20 E-services VAT to be paid to the Belarus government by UpWork is $20 x 20% = $4Total fees includingVATis $16 +$4= $20Take-home earnings after service fees and VAT - $80.00It kills the idea of remote working. You need to pay about a quarter of your income. That\u2019s mean you work one week for nothing. Plus, some bank, wire transfer, debit cards fees\u2026 May be it will be more profitable to find clients in your own city or country.I work as a legal entity for about couple of years. I am not a private consumer. I have sole proprietorship or individual entrepreneurship (\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c).

This is because some Android device manufacturers like Xiaomi, Oppo, One Plus, Vivo, Lenovo, Huawei, Samsung, and a few others, customize their operating systems (known as stock ROMs). When the app is cleared on such a device, it kills the app and its background services, which ultimately disables push notifications. If you\u2019re experiencing issues with notifications, find your device brand below and try taking the following steps to manually enable the auto-launch feature for background services:SamsungHuaweiXiaomiOppoVivoLenovoOpen Settings and select Background app management. Allow the Upwork for Freelancers app to start up in the background.One plusPlease note: because this issue is specific to certain stock ROMs and is not a native Android feature, the terminology used by each manufacturer is different and the auto-launch settings page is located in different places for certain devices.

                "George P": "Hi there everyone,I've never asked for advice from this community yet, but I've seen plenty of great answers from very knowledgeable people. I hope someone could provide some quality advice, as I truly would appreciate that.I tried not to be too lengthy here, but I also think this issue needs a bit of context.The issue that I currently face:I got contracted for $1,000 to do a Do-It-With-You consulting work package to help an insurance broker and ex. FINRA arbitrator ( the fact that he is an arbitrator is very relevant ) leverage LinkedIn as a platform, and learn to generate leads through a non-paid marketing approach.The job post & scope of work were as follows:**Edited for Community Guidelines**I delivered a 26-page guide + workbook, which also included the flow chart - and a total of 3.5hrs of 1-on-1 screen share video meetings vs. the 1HR agreed upon ( out of my generosity, because I truly believe in going above & beyond for my clients ), to make sure the set-up & consulting work will be concluded successfully.Client was seemingly happy when the work was done, the 2 funded milestones were approved & released at this stage, and I even offered BONUS support for another 14 days + a monthly check-in for the next 90 days to make sure the lead generation system I helped him set-up & coached on will work successfully for him.However, within 48hrs later, I wake up to an open dispute from this client, where he request a full refund because apparently, I have never done my job. He's an ex. FINRA arbitrator himself, and is trying very hard to reach and make his case.BUT not only did I over-deliver ( deliverables required + 3.5X more time than initially agreed upon ) - he's making false accusations ( which by the way blatantly contradict his own job post + our consulting time is video documented and proves his false claims ), he's also wanting to keep me responsible for things completely out of my control - such as a temporary hold on his account with the software tool I recommended ( most likely he did not follow the best practices recommended by me ), or the fact that he doesn't own anything.I DO NOT own that software company I recommended, I do NOT own & control LinkedIn's choices for client's profile either, and most marketing agencies & freelancers have built their entire business on other people's platforms. It was well communicated from the outset, yet he's trying to make his case for a refund with silly points like this.In this case - we couldn't get to an agreement in the mediation phase, and our mediation specialist suggests we escalate to arbitration.I know I'm 100% within the scope of work & I delivered successfully, client seems to have a very 'litigious' attitude & practices lots of legal threats and intimidation tactics - but by no means I want to waste my time & money on an arbitration process where I can still lose money, even if I win, due to the arbitration fees.My question, in this case, is - can I refuse the proposed agreements by our mediation specialist, and then also refuse to participate in the arbitration process? Or am I obligated to participate & pay arbitration fees if we did NOT reach a mutual agreement in the mediation phase?I'm 99.9% sure arbitration would go in my favor - however, I do not want to waste money & time on the process, and have my Upwork account on temporary hold until the issue is being solved - but I also can't let a 'bully' client use intimidation tactics to obtain a refund, in the eventuality of 0.01% he'd win the arbitration just because he used to be a FINRA arbitrator himself and may know the 'ins & outs' of winning cases that are not even favorable to him.I am NOT a lawyer or arbitrator, but I think we've all heard about judicial cases won not on true merit, but on the ability of the lawyers to get what they want. I'm thinking this client is an ex arbitrator and would be very persuasive to make his case - even though it would have to do impossible mental gymnastics in my opinion.Looking forward to hearing your opinions on what options am I looking at, and what course of action would you suggest in this scenario.Thanks a lot!George",
                "Petra R": "My question, in this case, is - can I refuse the proposed agreements by our mediation specialist, and then also refuse to participate in the arbitration process? Or am I obligated to participate & pay arbitration fees if we did NOT reach a mutual agreement in the mediation phase?You would be obliged to participate. (See the terms of service) If the client goes ahead with arbitration and you refuse, your account is suspended.That said, you get the chance to go for arbitration first, and once you do, it is entirely possible that the client, knowing that their bluff has been called, will decline, and you'd get to keep your money and your arbitration fee back.If you are that certain that you're in the right, don't back down.",
                "Preston H": "George:You made a tactical mistake.In the future, do not agree to a $1000 fixed-price contract with someone you don't know.As a freelancer AND as a client, it makes sense to start small.No more than about an hour's worth of work for the first fixed-price contract. The client needs to demonstrate that she can be trusted to use the fixed-price contract model correctly. After the client demonstrates that she can be trusted... Then you can use increasingly larger contracts with that client.If a client demonstrates that she doesn't use the fixed-price contract model correctly, worst case scenario would be that you can walk away from it without getting paid. Of course you don't want that to happen, but it is better to not get paid for an hour of work versus not getting paid work that took many days or weeks to do.",

Of course you don't want that to happen, but it is better to not get paid for an hour of work versus not getting paid work that took many days or weeks to do.It doesn't matter how many small milestones you do when it gets to this point. The client can ask for the full contract money back. They will be asked why they released the milestone during arbitration, so it would be arguably difficult to explain why the client released when they weren't satisfied, but if it is a situation where the provider promised to do something in return for release, I would bet this would be taken into consideration.But again, it doesn't matter how many milestones there are. The client can ask for a full refund, so you don't really protect yourself unless the milestones are individually separate from each other. But when milestones build onto each other and the end product is no good, clients will ask for all their money back and it doesn't matter how many milestones were completed."

In addition to increasing your visibility, this change will help protect clients and freelancers from off-platform work, which is against our Terms of Service.\"I'm totally agree with this initiative! But I want to ask Upwork: is it possible to show in top of search results freelancers with more hours worked through Upwork? That would reward freelancers who work many hours/years and is really loyal to this platform! Currently often happens so that new freelancers is in top of search results and many experienced freelancers is in the middle of search results list. That is not stimulating to work for years through this platform! In this case it is easier to open new freelancer account and get in the top of search rather than work hard for many years, earn reputation, gain top rated, etc...",

Ask yourself why they don't hire people who already have what they need. There are millions of freelancers to chose from.I don't know what their game is, probably getting work for free. I find it very suspicious that you didn't even apply.

You will never hear from them again.",

                "Will L": "Hi, Chlarise.Far too many clients on Upwork do not know the details of how Upwork works. Your client may be one of them, so if either his payment method is not approved or TimeTracker is not yet available, tell the client, as diplomatically as possible, that you've just noticed the problem(s) and he needs to address this as soon as possible.In my experience, getting a payment method approved by Upwork is not a long process, so the approval should be in place within a couple of days. But the client needs to start the process immediately, if he hasn't already.Under Upwork's rules you don't have a valid hourly contract to do work on until Time Tracker is available for you to document your work time for a client. And if the client's payment method has not been approved by Upwork, even if you track your work time using Time Tracker it is not covered by Upwork's excellent hourly payment protection. (This should not be allowed, but it is.)So, you shouldn't do any work on an hourly contract until you can use Time Tracker to keep track of your work time and Upwork confirms the client's payment method is approved.If things are going well and your training really is about training and is not about doing work the client can use without being paid for it, then your best option, if the client has given you no reason to distrust him, may be to keep close track of your manual time and add it to Time Tracker as soon as TimeTracker is available to you, then switch to tracking all work time using Time Tracker properly. When you add the manual time Time Tracker, tell the client so he isn't surprised when he sees it in his Upwork invoice. I'd also send him a daily accounting of my manual work time, so he knows what to expect.As others here have said, all work time you add manually on any project is not covered by Upwork's excellent hourly protection. By definition, you do not know and have no reason to trust this new client will pay you, so do anything possible to avoid using additional manual time during the earliest days of your work with him.Good luck!"

I already readed something about on upw forum, but I still have some questions:1) at least, will I be paid or there is the risk to loose my payment?2) In case I loose my payment, is there something I can do with the client? The contract has hourly payment but with manual methodMore often than not such holds are resolved fairly quickly, but there is nothing you can do, the client needs to fix it.The most common issue is that the client did not pay last week's hours (payment method declined) which means last week's hours were not paid (NOTE: That may not be the problem in your case, but it is the most common reason) and if that is the case, the fact that your time was manual would mean that you are not protected for any hours logged last week and this week.",
                "Francesca G": "Thank you for your answer. I'm a bit astonished because the last payment of my client is in review now (review that ends today), so I thought Upwork has already checked the client payment method almost two weeks ago, even because in this two week I could have worked for him.Or maybe I'm wrong and the payment actually in review will be sended to me as usual?",

It is your success score.As per the guidelines from upwork, if your contract is on hold for more than 2-3 weeks without response from your client, you should end it from your side else it will have negative impact on your score.I have already suffered from this for one contract and it affected my score negatively.Hope this will help.Thanks"
