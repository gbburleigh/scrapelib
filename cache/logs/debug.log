            "Ciprian M": "Hi Will,Sorry for not posting the outcome of my dispute here.The mediator insisted that a third-party arbitration is no need to go forward on my case because is time-consuming and costs money.The mediator convinced the client to pay me another 15% percent or so of the remaining escrow money and the rest of the amount remaining to be paid around 40% percent was paid to me by Upwork. They call it a courtesy credit.So, in the end, the client got away with my work by paying only 30% of the agreed amount and I got paid about 70% of the agreed amount.I am not proud of myself for accepting this deal but I did not know my chances of winning the dispute and I was not ready to pay for the arbitration fees.Anyway, I still encourage other freelancers who deal with similar situations to open a dispute if they feelfooled.",
            "Will L": "Thanks for the update, Ciprian.I assume Upwork can't afford to spend $291 on arbitration to resolve disputes very often, so it's interesting they wouldn't allow it in your case. The 40% Upwork paid to you must have been less, and maybe much less, than $291?All things considered, you probably did as well as you could expect.We'll never know if the client learned his lesson, but only paying 30% of the agreed price for your work is a pretty good deal - for him. Upwork paid you more than he did for your work."
