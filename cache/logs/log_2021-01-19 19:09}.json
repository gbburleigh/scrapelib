I did the logo and sent him a pre-final version and told him that I would do mockups and send him different color variations. He said to change a minor thing on the design and I agreed, but he simply responded that he \"doesn't need the mockups and sh**t\" and abruptly ended the contract without an explanation. He also wants a refund of 50$ even though he hasn't paid me for any milestone. What's the best thing to do and what are my options. Can I get a bad review? Is there a way for UpWork or the client to pay 50$ for the project I spent valuable time on?Thanks in advance"

I check she is a Payment Method Verified, because I don't see any contract for this client.Then, I ask to Upwork Customer Support to check is it safe or not to work with her and he say \"Yes\" it safe since we have hourly protection and Upwork will guarantee the hours he said.Then I started working with the tight deadline (2 weeks) and spent much time and healthy every week.when the deadline is coming up (2 weeks in the Friday) client was happy and he says will do the Demo for the project and she say will back in 1 week, and she ended the contract (due holiday or something).I have facing not quite right in the Friday, since I'm Top Rated and usually get Faster Payment and for this Client I don't get it, I wonder and I ask to Customer Service Upwork, and he says no problem as you work good because Upwork have Hourly Protection, Ok no problem for now.I have read the Payment Protection also, I'm working with the honest. If Im cheating in Upwork I don't want to create this Topic.Because the first week I got the Payment ProtectionSecond week (I don't get payment protection) could u imagine if I cheating the hourly exactly 53 hours, how can I get 53 hours if I cheating?I ask to Customer Support 3 times!and then next week in the Wednesday I got the payment with the email from CS the client unsuccessful payment bla bla bla and Upwork cover to pay.this time I'm happy because my hours in the first week is paid.and then next week (this is the last payment, same happen the payment is not Faster on the Friday) so I need to wait to next week on Wednesday (Today).I have an emails that means xxxx much my money refunded with Upwork with no reason, with no notification to me why this happen? this is very not fair, where is the hourly protection?While Im working so hard and spent much time and healthy and Upwork get refunded so easily?If Client cheating in this platform why they are here to cheating us Freelancers?I don't understand with this, Upwork not check the Work Diary? and just get refund from Freelancer?The refund almost fully, working so hard 53 hours a week it's very very not fair!I have told Upwork before started, and why this refunded happen in the last payment and exactly in the time for paying to freelancer, why Upwork not checking the client account when the contract still running?Is the Client cheated on Upwork? very easy to cheating freelancer.I'm joined Upwork in 2019, I have never facing this problem before all contracts and clients was good. but for now I have a bad experience very very bad experience because my work is not paid and Upwork not guaranteed the hours while u working so hard and spent much time and healthy?could u imagine how much hours you can gave daily when u working 53 hours in a week for 1 client?

I check she is a Payment Method Verified, because I don't see any contract for this client.Then, I ask to Upwork Customer Support to check is it safe or not to work with her and he say \"Yes\" it safe since we have hourly protection and Upwork will guarantee the hours he said.Then I started working with the tight deadline (2 weeks) and spent much time and healthy every week.when the deadline is coming up (2 weeks in the Friday) client was happy and he says will do the Demo for the project and she say will back in 1 week, and she ended the contract (due holiday or something).I have facing not quite right in the Friday, since I'm Top Rated and usually get Faster Payment and for this Client I don't get it, I wonder and I ask to Customer Service Upwork, and he says no problem as you work good because Upwork have Hourly Protection, Ok no problem for now.I have read the Payment Protection also, I'm working with the honest. If Im cheating in Upwork I don't want to create this Topic.Because the first week I got the Payment ProtectionSecond week (I don't get payment protection) could u imagine if I cheating the hourly exactly 53 hours, how can I get 53 hours if I cheating?I ask to Customer Support 3 times!and then next week in the Wednesday I got the payment with the email from CS the client unsuccessful payment bla bla bla and Upwork cover to pay.this time I'm happy because my hours in the first week is paid.and then next week (this is the last payment, same happen the payment is not Faster on the Friday) so I need to wait to next week on Wednesday (Today).I have an emails that means xxxx much my money refunded with Upwork with no reason, with no notification to me why this happen? this is very not fair, where is the hourly protection?While Im working so hard and spent much time and healthy and Upwork get refunded so easily?If Client cheating in this platform why they are here to cheating us Freelancers?I don't understand with this, Upwork not check the Work Diary? and just get refund from Freelancer?The refund almost fully, working so hard 53 hours a week it's very very not fair!I have told Upwork before started, and why this refunded happen in the last payment and exactly in the time for paying to freelancer, why Upwork not checking the client account when the contract still running?Is the Client cheated on Upwork? very easy to cheating freelancer.I'm joined Upwork in 2019, I have never facing this problem before all contracts and clients was good. but for now I have a bad experience very very bad experience because my work is not paid and Upwork not guaranteed the hours while u working so hard and spent much time and healthy?could u imagine how much hours you can gave daily when u working 53 hours in a week for 1 client? I have 3 clients. it means I have working more than 53 hours, and this client almost make me headache and not good for health because I need to work almost 12-14 hours a day for only 1 client.Anybody can help me with this problem, Please help is outside here and there has same experience with me?",

            "Rafsun S": "My opinion is to continue the tracker as long as you work on the project.Don't worry about the 10 minutes or the screenshot. Tracking time and capturing screenshots is Upwork's job. It also counts the keyboard and mouse click. So longtime gap will show less performance though I believe, it doesn't always count 100% correct.I usually stop the tracker when I need to do other small things that might need one minute plus such as smoking (as I don't smoke in my home) or going washroom. I start the tracker again when I start the project.A screenshot is useful evidence. Now, if you browse something that is non-related to the project and if the screenshot was captured on that, a hard client might be dissatisfied.",

The screenshot is what logs the time, but if you stop the tracker without having at least 7 minutes of activity you risk losing it if you need the payment protection or if the client disputes."
